  abstract = {For a given set of operating conditions, the hydrogen production from biomass gasification can be improved through optimization of the operating parameters and efficiencies. The present approach can predict hydrogen production via biomass gasification in a range of 10--32kg/s from biomass (sawdust wood). The biomass is introduced to a gasifier at an operating temperature range of 1000--1500K. Also, 4.5kg/s of steam at 500K is used as gasification medium. Results indicate that improvement in hydrogen production from biomass steam gasification depending on the amount of steam and quantity of biomass feeding to the gasifier as well the operating temperature. Over the range of feeding biomass, the hydrogen yield reaches 80--130g H2/kg biomass while in the operating temperature examined, the hydrogen yield reaches 80g H2/kg biomass. On mole basis it is found that, in the first range of H2 varies from 51 to 63\% in the studied range of feeding biomass in existing 4.5kg/s from steam while H2 gets to 51--53\% in existing of 6.3kg/s from steam.},

  abstract = {The availability of natural gas as feedstock for nitrogen fertilizer production continues to decline, while its price increases, encouraging the search for renewable feedstocks for the future green urea industry. Renewable feedstocks include waste biomass, hydrogen from solar PV-\-electrolysis, and the combination of these feedstocks with natural gas. The selection of a green production strategy is a critical step in the trade-\-off between economic and environmental considerations. The aim of this work was to propose a green urea production strategy using a multi-\-objective optimization (MOO) model to minimize production costs and environmental impacts by considering the future cost development of technologies and feedstock price for each technology in the time frame of 2020-\-2050. The results show that green urea production can reduce production costs and greenhouse gas emissions, compared to conventional urea production. Biomass gasification technology fulfills the minimum requirements for production cost and CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2035 and combined biomass gasification-\-PV electrolysis without battery technology is the optimum process from 2040 to 2050.},

  abstract = {The production of renewable chemicals and fuels is driving modern society towards a type of sustainable development which involves a decreasing dependency on fossil fuels and the minimisation of waste. Biomass, a waste by-product from the urban environment, is a carbon dioxide neutral organic fuel that can potentially serve as a feedstock for the production of sustainable power and heat. Gasification is preferred over the other thermal conversion options for biomass processing whereby the product synthesis gas can be utilised to power generators/turbines and generate clean energy, ammonia and methanol. Incidentally, efficient and economically sound biomass driven supply chains can be integrated into an existing petrochemical infrastructure. Moreover, the potential production volumes of fuels and green chemicals can also be increased by the addition of multiple biomass sources, thereby creating potential positive scale effects. This study proposes a new poly-generation process that utilises multiple sources of biomass feedstock to produce high quality urea, methanol, Fisher-Tropsch liquids and power. Four flowsheet configurations are simulated using Aspen Plus software and the built-in capabilities of the activated analysis using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer and Aspen Energy Analyzer to perform the economic, energy and environmental impact calculations. The results demonstrate that the methanol production technique is the most economic process pathway with a net profit of approximately \$0.035 per kg of biomass input, whilst the urea process pathway presents the lowest environmental impact solution with approximately 0.71\,kg of CO2-e per kg of biomass input. These results are relative and can be analysed from different perspectives based on the market demand of the products and their applications and local need. For instance, considering at the economic and environmental indicators relative to the production capacity, production of liquid fuels achieve net profits of approximately \$0.27 per kg of product, whilst urea production demonstrates the lowest environmental emissions of approximately 3.93\,kg of CO2-e per kg of product.},

This method uses an addition of the Levenberg--Marquardt step and an approximate LM step as the trial step at every iteration. Using a trust region technique, the global and cubic convergence of the MLM method under the local error bound condition is proved (Fan, 2012). Recently, Fan proposed an accelerated MLM algorithm by using a line search strategy to generate a modified LM step and showed that the convergence rate of the algorithm is min\{1+2{$\delta$},3\} which results the cubic convergence for {$\delta\geq$}1 (Fan, 2014). In this paper, by introducing an adaptive LM parameter for AMLM algorithm, we propose an efficient AMLM algorithm. The cubic convergence of the new algorithm is presented while numerical experiments show the new algorithm is promising.},

However, it is not uncommon that coffee husk is entirely discarded despite their potential as fuel briquette. Furthermore, coffee husk may replace tapioca as a non-edible binder alternative to tapioca. As such, this study aims to determine the potential of coffee husk waste as briquette material and binder. Manufacturing parameters that include the particle size, the biomass-to-binder ratio, and the press pressure, were varied, and the briquettes were analyzed based on the high heating value (HHV), and using proximate and ultimate analyses under ASTM standards. In addition, common combustion characteristics, such as flame temperature, ignition time, burning duration, and burning rate were determined. The highest HHV was found in coffee husk briquettes without adhesive at 3811 Kcal/Kg. The combustion characteristic test showed that briquettes with a particle size of 60 mesh and a press pressure of 2 MPa have the most desired combustion characteristics.},

In this paper, we opted to model the CO2 capture plant using an equilibrium-based approach. To validate the optimization results obtained and to verify the absorber and desorber dimensions, we sized both columns. Packing heights remain below the threshold of 15 metres and productivity ranges between 0.74 tCO2/m3h at a capture rate of 90\% and 0.35 tCO2/m3h for a CO2 recovery of 99.8\% respectively.},

The approach is aimed at a thorough understanding of the issues and methods for practical computation while avoiding an extensive theorem-proof type of exposition. It also addresses reasons why existing software succeeds or fails. This is a practical and mathematically well informed introduction that emphasizes basic methods and theory, issues in the use and development of mathematical software, and examples from scientific engineering applications. Topics requiring an extensive amount of mathematical development are introduced, motivated, and included in the exercises, but a complete and rigorous mathematical presentation is referenced rather than included.},

However, their black box nature can limit how much one can trust and learn from the developed models. Here seven different machine learning methods have been adopted to model the gasification of biomass and waste across a wide range of operating conditions. Gradient boosting regression has been found to outperform the other model types with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.90 when averaged across ten key gasification outputs. Global and local model interpretability methods have been used to illuminate the developed black box models. The studied models were most strongly influenced by the feedstock's particle size and the type of gasifying agent employed. By combining global and local interpretability methods, the understanding of black box models has been improved. This allows policy makers and investors to make more educated decisions about gasification process design.},

The process included a countercurrent packed-bed absorber operating under high-pressure over a wide range of temperatures and three pressure-swing flash drums for solvent regeneration. Two packings, Mellapak 250Y and IMTP50, were used and the Levelized costs of CO2 captured (LCOC) were calculated. The simulation results indicated that using Mellapak 250Y exhibited lower LCOC values than those when using IMTP50 for the five solvents under all conditions used as it offered better mass transfer. The CO2 capture process carried out at low temperatures showed lower LCOC values than those at higher temperatures due to the increased CO2 solubility in the solvents at lower temperatures, requiring smaller absorber diameter and lower solvent circulation rates, which offset the cooling requirements. Comparing the lowest LCOC values for the five solvents, the hydrophobic PEGPDMS-1 solvent was the most promising one compared to the other four solvents, due to its lowest capital and operating costs and noncorrosive, which enabled using less expensive materials for the process equipment.},

The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.The third edition contains major improvements and revisions throughout the book. More than 300 new exercises have been added since the previous edition. Many new examples have been added to illustrate the key ideas of linear algebra. New topics covered in the book include product spaces, quotient spaces, and dual spaces. Beautiful new formatting creates pages with an unusually pleasant appearance in both print and electronic versions.No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus the text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator.},

The performance of a gasification process can be estimated using thermodynamic equilibrium models. This type of model generally assumes the system reaches equilibrium, while in reality the system may only approach equilibrium leading to some errors between experimental and model results. In this study non-stoichiometric equilibrium models are modified and improved with correction factors inserted into the design equations so that when the Gibbs free energy is minimized model predictions will more closely match experimental values. The equilibrium models are implemented in MatLab and optimized based on experimental values from the literature using the optimization toolbox. The modified non-stoichiometric models are shown to be more accurate than unmodified models based on the calculated root mean square error values. These models can be applied for various types of solid biomass for the production of syngas through biomass gasification processes such as wood, agricultural, and crop residues.},

  abstract = {The recent crisis in Italian agriculture has forced operators to find new ways of deriving income from their activities. One of the most promising of these is the use of agricultural products and residues as an energy source. In particular, the exploitation of agricultural, industrial and forestry residues and by-products can be a definite advantage in the generation of electrical and thermal energy. This is due to the fact that these materials need to be disposed of and, therefore represent cost, and can be then transformed into an opportunity for revenue. Among the various technologies available for converting biomass into biofuels, thermochemical gasification appears to be the most suitable for the conversion of crop residues (corn and sunflower stalks, rapeseed straw, etc.) as these are characterized by low humidity and a high C/N ratio. On the other hand, the operational problems encountered with current plant architectures, such as the blocking of the biomass flow in the reactor due to low-melting ash content, have limited the use of crop residues in gasification so far. In this paper, a model for the simulation of the biomass thermochemical gasification process is presented. The model is based on a chemical equilibrium hypothesis, i.e. it is assumed that the chemical transformations inside the gasifier can be described by a series of equilibrium reactions independent of each other and, therefore, a precise relationship between products and reactants can be determined. The model is validated by a comparison with data from literature and a sensitivity analysis on process parameters is presented. Finally, the model is applied to the study of the reliability of the gasification of crop residues currently popular in Italy, both in terms of produced gas quality and quantity.},

Gasification enables the conversion of these materials into combustible gas, mechanical and electrical power, synthetic fuels and chemicals. In view of the considerable interest in the gasification process worldwide, it is necessary to model and predict the performance of the gasifier in priori. Modeling of biomass gasification implies the representation of chemical and physical phenomena constituting pyrolysis, combustion, reduction and drying in a mathematical form. In the present study, steady state composition and temperature profiles for the reduction zone of a downdraft biomass gasifier are predicted. A model reported in the literature is modified by incorporating the variation of the char reactivity factor (CRF) along the reduction zone of the downdraft biomass gasifier. Increasing the CRF exponentially along the reduction bed length in the model gave better predictions of the temperature and composition profiles when compared with the experimental data and earlier models reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Biomass is being considered seriously as a source of energy generation worldwide. Among the various routes available for biomass based energy generation, biomass gasification is one of the most important routes that are being studied extensively. Biomass gasification is a thermo-chemical conversion process of biomass materials within a reactor. Number of inter-related parameters concerning the type of fuel, the reactor design and operating parameters effect the functioning of the gasifier. Understanding of this working principle is essential for the end user. The end user may be an individual who is interested in the output of the gasifier or the reactor manufacturer who is interested to develop the most optimum design or a planner who is in requirement of a gasifier which will give the best performance for a specific fuel type. Research and development both in the experimental and computational aspect of gasification has been numerous. Computational modeling tools are advantageous in many situations due to their capability of allowing the user to find the optimum conditions for a given reactor without going in for actual experimentation which is both time consuming and expensive. The modeling works of gasification process requires a systematic logical analysis in order to efficiently disseminate the embedded information. An attempt has been made in this study to categorise the recent modeling works based on certain specific criteria such as type of gasifier, feedstock, modeling considerations and evaluated parameters. Comparative assessments are made of the modeling techniques and output for each category of the models. The information is anticipated to be useful for researchers, end users as well as planners.},

  abstract = {This work deals with the modelling of a travelling bed waste gasifier. This gasifier is a part of a more general process devoted to the production of electricity from waste and refused derived fuel. In a first stage the load is dried and gasified in a travelling bed gasifier using air with an equivalence ratio of 0.3. This product gas contains light hydrocarbons as well as tars. It is converted into a syngas free from tars in a specific reformer (Turboplasma{\copyright}) that uses plasma technology in order to raise the temperature of the incoming gas to a value compatible with thermal cracking of tars. The model of the travelling bed gasifier is based on the coupling between a software devoted to the description of the chemical and physical processes occurring within the travelling bed, and a CFD package (Fluent™) that allows for the description of the homogenous gas reaction and radiation occurring within the freeboard of the bed. The first software is a ``home made'' software based on the conservation equations of the solid, liquid and gas phases as well as of the energy. The balance equations are firstly written at the ``phase scale'', and then, using a homogenisation technique (volume averaging) balance equations are derived at a representative volume scale. In this first work, this model is written using a one dimensional formalism along the axis of the travelling bed. Wood is used as a case study material with a pyrolysis mechanism that uses three parallel reactions leading to the formation of gas, tars and char. The gas and tars produced during the pyrolysis step can be converted within the bed itself but also over the freeboard of the bed. Hence, the free board of the bed is used as a boundary condition of the CFD domain, with known local mass flow-rate, composition and temperature. This study allows for a complete and precise description of the processes occurring within the gasifier under consideration.},

The results of tests with different feedstocks (corn cobs, wood pellets, rice husks and vine pruning) in a demonstrative downdraft gasifier (350kW) were used for validation. The average discrepancy between model and experimental results was up to 8 times less than the one with the simple equilibrium model. The repartition factor was successfully related to the operating conditions and characteristics of the biomass to simulate different conditions of the gasifier (variation in potentiality, densification and mixing of feedstock) and analyze the model sensitivity.},

Heat and mass transfer across the bed are coupled with moisture evaporation, biomass pyrolysis, char combustion and gasification, gas-phase combustion and thermal cracking of tars. Numerical simulation has allowed to predict the influence of model parameters, kinetic constants and operational variables on process dynamics, structure of the reaction front and quality of the producer gas. In particular, two different stabilization modes of the reaction front have been determined. For high values of the air-to-fuel ratio and of the primary pyrolysis rate, the process is top-stabilized, resulting in a high conversion efficiency and good gas quality. As the air flow is decreased below a critical limit value, the reaction front becomes grate-stabilized. The two different configurations are largely determined by the gas-phase combustion of volatile pyrolysis products. Finally, the predictions of the gas composition and the axial temperature profiles are in agreement with experimental data.},

  abstract = {The production and use of mineral fertilizers contributes significantly to the carbon footprint of agricultural crops and crop-based food products. In arable crops such as winter wheat the share of nitrogen (N) fertilizer-related GHG emissions can be as high as 80\%. The contribution of emissions from the production of mineral fertilizers is often as important as fertilizer-induced emissions from agricultural soils. It is therefore important to use appropriate and up-to-date emission data for fertilizer production, which represent the actual technology and efficiency of manufacturing of specific fertilizer grades. Objective of this study is to provide up-to-date carbon footprint data for the main fertilizer products produced in selected world regions. The association of the European fertilizer producers " Fertilizers Europe " has developed a carbon footprint calculator (CFC) for fertilizer production. This tool has been employed to derive reference values for the main mineral fertilizers produced in Europe and other relevant fertilizer-producing regions of the world. The European data are reported by all members in a regular survey to Fertilizers Europe and are representative for the year 2011. Reported data include energy consumption in ammonia synthesis (Haber-Bosch) and N 2 O emissions from nitric acid production, as well as expert-validated data for other sources of CO 2 (e.g. energy consumption for urea synthesis and granulation). The non-European figures are based on an expert evaluation by Integer Research Ltd. of ammonia and nitric acid production in 2011, while for all other emission sources the European values were used. The Fertilizers Europe CFC follows general LCA and carbon footprint rules. It covers all main sources of GHG emissions and has been reviewed by DNV GL to verify its completeness and correct calculations. This paper explains the methodology applied in the calculation of the carbon footprint values. In addition the results will be presented per fertilizer product and production region. We suggest that these data should be used in carbon footprint studies as reference values for fertilizer production in different world regions with the technology baseline 2011.},

Following a brief introduction to computing in general, the author presents a thorough guide to problem-solving and algorithm design using pseudo-code to develop an understanding of the steps that need to be taken to solve a particular problem. Subsequent chapters introduce the main features of Fortran 90 motivated by particular ideas and tasks that are typically found in science and engineering courses. Each chapter includes at least two complete programming applications which become progressively more challenging as the book develops. As a result, readers are encouraged to develop a sound understanding both of programming in Fortran 90 and of the invaluable tool it offers for addressing complex science and engineering problems. Students coming to computing for the first time will find the wide range of problems both accessible and relevant to their other studies.},

  abstract = {In the present study, co-gasification behaviors of rice husk (RH) and blends of two woody biomasses, sawdust (SD) and bamboo dust (BD) in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) system were studied by using ASPEN plus software. The gasifier performance was evaluated in respect of the gas yield and its higher heating value (HHV), in addition to the char conversion efficiency (CCE) and cold gas efficiency (CGE). The present study effectively showed that the blending of biomasses significantly improves the producer gas quality in terms of H2 production and energy output, as well as the gasifier performance indicators. RH~+~SD blend showed both the highest higher heating value (4.79 MJ/Nm3) and H2 content (12.51~vol \%) at 900~{$^\circ$}C and ER of 0.24. The simulation results also showed that the gas yield was the highest for RH~+~BD blend (1.75 Nm3/kg) followed by RH~+~SD blend (1.73 Nm3/kg) and then RH (1.41 Nm3/kg) at 900~{$^\circ$}C. The highest HHV of RH (4.71 MJ/Nm3), RH~+~SD (5.17 MJ/Nm3) and RH~+~BD (5.39 MJ/Nm3) were also obtained at 800~{$^\circ$}C and ER of 0.19. Change in the steam/biomass (S/B) also showed a slight variation in gasifier performance parameters.},

  abstract = {A renewed interest revolves around ammonia through its synthesis via renewable energy sources, promoting green ammonia as a genuine contender and preeminent carbon-free energy carrier within the hydrogen economy. A National Hydrogen Strategy has already been set by the Portuguese Government, focusing on decarbonizing the national industry, while substantially reducing natural gas and fossil fuel-based ammonia imports. This study delivers a techno-economic assessment of a small-scale green ammonia production facility using biomass gasification in mainland Portugal. An improved economic model combining the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), modified internal rate of return (MIRR), payback period (PBP), and discounted payback period (DPBP) is set to determine the project feasibility. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis is implemented to gauge the risks associated with the venture. Several environmental considerations are also addressed concerning the carbon footprint of deploying a biomass-to-ammonia system compared to conventional fossil fuel-based ammonia. Under current market conditions, the power plant is predictably economically feasible with an NPV of 3714 k{\texteuro}, IRR of 24.32\%, MIRR of 14.99\%, PBP of 4.6 years, and DPBP of 5.8 years. The sensitivity analysis foresees affordable risks for investors, although investment loss is more likely to occur due to NPV failure, being remarkably sensitive to ammonia production and ammonia sales price fluctuations. Finally, the geographic location set for the biomass-to-ammonia power plant has the potential to enable a bioeconomy and circular economy framework for increased renewability and improved productivity, while promoting sustainable agricultural practices in the region.},

Here a set of indicator system, composed of energy use, economic cost, and emissions' impacts in terms of emergy and carbon emission intensity, were built to investigate this issue. Next six scenarios of Chinese urea production, attained through combination of two ammonia synthesis methods and three urea production methods, were evaluated. The study results show that (1) urea production from natural gas (UPNG) should pay more attention to indirect energy use of raw materials and energy sources while urea production from coal (UPC) should more emphasize energy efficiency of production processes, (2) dust emissions should be emphasized for carbon dioxide stripping technology and ammonia stripping technology, while more attention should be paid to NH3--N discharge from urea production using aqueous solution full-cycle technology, (3) UPNG are worse than UPC according to energy consumption intensity and economic cost but better than the latter in terms of emissions' impacts, and (4) generally combination of coal based ammonia synthesis and ammonia stripping method is the best one.},

The model predicts the temperature, gas composition and char yield at the exit of the gasifier for a specified set of heat loss and input condition. A parametric study has been conducted to simulate the influences of the air/feed mass ratio and moisture/feed mass ratio on the gasifier's performance. The model predictions are compared with a comprehensive set of experimental data obtained from the gasification of wood in a commercial-scale downdraft gasifier; the air/feed ratios range from 1.1 to 2.1 and the moisture/feed ratios range from 0.05 to 0.3. The predicted trends for variations in the operating parameters are in general agreement with the experimental data. The results of comparisons also indicate that the performance of the wood gasifier can be approximated reasonably well by the equilibrium model.},

  abstract = {The work discussed the necessity to evaluate the environmental effect -- i.e. carbon footprint (CF), of N-containing fertilizers when including their production, transportation and use. For that purpose, life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was involved. The LCA-based CF concerned model fertilizer technology determined with the consideration of greenhouse gases assimilation during fertilizer-induced vegetation, as compared to non-treated crops system. According to the available data, the inclusion of CO2 assimilation by plants via photosynthesis in balance sheet offsets 87.6\% of the CF from the biomass consumption. Thus, the new approach to LCA along with the analysis of life cycle costs would provide more reliable determination of the fee amount charged to European fertilizer manufacturers. The approach might be further developed for various products for plant treatment. Also, the verification of similar fertilizer technologies in different installations is expected to identify bottlenecks in terms of the ecological, technical and economic evaluation.},

The equilibrium conditions have been reached from the right-hand side components. The equilibrium medium is then liquid. From the equilibrium constant relative to molal fractions, an enthalpy variation for the forward reaction of 5.5 kcal mol-1 can be derived. The kinetics of this forward reaction have been investigated in conditions where the carbamate remains partly solid. It follows the Prout-Tompkins law, which is interpreted by the ability for water in contact with the solid to create germs of its decomposition. The activation energy of reaction 1 is about 10 kcal mol-1.},

  abstract = {Ammonia is a widely produced industrial chemical, primarily for use in the fertilizer industry. Recently, interest has also grown in ammonia as a carbon-free energy carrier because it is easier to store and transport than hydrogen. However, ammonia is primarily produced from natural gas with a considerable carbon footprint if the produced CO2 is not captured and stored. This work therefore presents a new ammonia production method based on membrane-assisted autothermal reforming (MA-ATR) for hydrogen production from natural gas with integrated CO2 capture. The MA-ATR reactor offers great process intensification benefits, leading to considerable efficiency gains as well as a simpler and cheaper plant. In the base case, MA-ATR achieves 10.7\% greater efficiency, 14.9\% lower NH3 production costs and 16.5\%-points greater CO2 avoidance than a conventional ammonia plant where captured CO2 is compressed for transport and storage. This economic advantage of MA-ATR increases with higher natural gas prices, lower electricity prices, lower membrane costs and higher CO2 prices. All elements of the proposed plant are mature technologies aside from the membranes and the oxygen carrier material. Further development and demonstration of these two elements is therefore recommended to realize the promising techno-economic performance reported in this study.},

Kinetics used include both our own kinetic data and published equations with some corrective factors. The reaction network used involves twelve different reactions. A sub-model for the tar generation-elimination in the CFBBG is included in the whole model. The model has an academic structure, but several assumptions were made because of lack of accurate data in some areas. The overall model has some empirical aspects and can therefore be considered as semirigorous. Hydrodynamics in the model were checked with a survey carried out worldwide among the existing pilot and commercial CFBBGs. The axial profiles of concentration of ten different species (H2, CO, CO2, tar, char, . . .) and temperature can be calculated with this model which was conceived to optimize both design and operation of CFBBGs.},

Currently, most bioelectricity production in Brazil is derived from sugar cane bagasse. With the aim of contributing to Brazilian bioenergy initiatives and development, this study assesses the potential for electrical energy generation from three agricultural byproducts generated in large quantities: rice straw, sugar cane straw, and coffee husks. The investigation for bioenergy potential determination was carried out considering the direct combustion of 100\% of these materials in every Brazilian municipality that registers rice, sugar cane or coffee cultures. Statistical analysis and potential maps were constructed using these data. The results revealed a total generated potential of 15~GW (105.1~TWh/y) from these three residues, with around 90\% originating from sugar cane. The southeast region showed the greatest potential for sugar cane and coffee cultivation, while the most significant potential for rice cultivation is mainly located throughout the South and Central-West regions of the country.},

To this aim, the developed model is coupled with a genetic algorithm (Moga II), to search for the optimal correction factors able to minimize the error between the computed and the experimentally measured product yields and temperatures. The approach is repeated to simulate the thermal treatment of different biomasses with increasing carbon content, from straw to sawdust. The possibility to resort to a unique set of correction factors for different biomasses is explored, that would allow the model being of particular interest for engineering applications, to trace the design guidelines for gasification systems.},

The model, implemented in the Matlab-Simulink{\textregistered} environment, is able to calculate the reactor main operating parameters, such as reaction temperature, gas composition, gas flow rate and solid product (typically charcoal). The comparison of model output with experimental data puts in evidence the insufficient precision of equilibrium models, due to their incapability of taking into account the non equilibrium effects always present in the gasification process. To obtain a better prediction of measured values the pure equilibrium model has been modified on the basis of literature experimental data, introducing semi-empirical correlations with the aim to consider the most meaningful effects of non-equilibrium. The results demonstrate that this modification leads to an increased precision of the model in reproducing experimental data.},

  abstract = {While studies have shown that anaerobic digestion (AD) with energy generation of agricultural residues have many benefits, it is still unclear the extent to which this technology can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly in the context of coffee husk wastes. To address this knowledge gap, this work explored three scenarios of coffee husks as an energy source: 0) business-as-usual (landfilling); 1) AD with energy generation; 2) same as the previous one, adding a hydrothermal hydrolysis pre-treatment step. The study adopted a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to estimate the environmental impacts of this technology in terms of GHG emissions. The results indicate that the main benefit of using AD is to avoid the impacts of landfilling, as the carbon footprint for the landfilling scenario was more than 13 times higher than the others. The emissions from digestate management were the main source of the overall emissions, accounting for 34~\%. However, its use to replace chemical fertilizers affected the environmental performance positively. The inclusion of the pre-treatment was a key factor in making the bioenergy from coffee husks less carbon-intensive than natural gas and oil, although common renewable sources such as wind and hydropower tend to have lower GHG emissions. Sensitivity analyses indicate that this type of bioenergy can mitigate GHG emissions from energy generation in coffee-producing countries with fossil-based energy mixes. Overall, this work fills a knowledge gap by providing empirical evidence to the potential benefits of using coffee husks in the world's transition to a low-carbon economy.},

  abstract = {This work examines the technical and economic feasibility of Biomass-To-Liquid (BTL) processes for the manufacture of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Six BTL systems are modelled and evaluated which are based on pressurised oxygen gasification of woody biomass, and specifically on circulating fluidised bed and entrained flow gasification systems. Three fuel synthesis technologies are considered: Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanol conversion followed by Methanol to Gasoline (MTG) and the Topsoe Integrated Gasoline (TIGAS) synthesis. Published modelling studies of BTL systems based on gasification have only used deterministic estimates of fuel production costs to assess economic viability without accounting for uncertainties of their model parameters. Unlike other studies, the present techno-economic assessment examines and quantifies the effect of uncertainty of key parameters on the fuel production costs. The results of this analysis show that there is a realistic chance (8--14\%) of concepts based on Fischer-Tropsch synthesis meeting the cost of conventional fuels; that this probability could be increased to 50\% with moderate tax incentives (an 8\% reduction in the tax rate); but that deterministic estimates may be systematically underestimating likely production costs. The overall energy efficiency and production costs of the BTL designs evaluated range from 37.9\% to 47.6\% LHV and {\texteuro}17.88--25.41 per GJ of produced fuels, respectively. The BTL concept with the lowest production costs incorporates CFB gasification and FT synthesis. The model deterministic estimates of production costs of this design indicate that a BTL process is not yet competitive with conventional refineries since the biofuel production costs are approximately 8\% higher than current market prices. Large scale biofuel production may be possible in the long term through subsidies, crude oil price rises and legislation.},

  abstract = {Chemical engineers rely on models for design, research, and daily decision-making, often with potentially large financial and safety implications. Previous efforts a few decades ago to combine artificial intelligence and chemical engineering for modeling were unable to fulfill the expectations. In the last five years, the increasing availability of data and computational resources has led to a resurgence in machine learning-based research. Many recent efforts have facilitated the roll-out of machine learning techniques in the research field by developing large databases, benchmarks, and representations for chemical applications and new machine learning frameworks. Machine learning has significant advantages over traditional modeling techniques, including flexibility, accuracy, and execution speed. These strengths also come with weaknesses, such as the lack of interpretability of these black-box models. The greatest opportunities involve using machine learning in time-limited applications such as real-time optimization and planning that require high accuracy and that can build on models with a self-learning ability to recognize patterns, learn from data, and become more intelligent over time. The greatest threat in artificial intelligence research today is inappropriate use because most chemical engineers have had limited training in computer science and data analysis. Nevertheless, machine learning will definitely become a trustworthy element in the modeling toolbox of chemical engineers.},

In this work, the conventional scenario of the black liquor use (i.e., concentration and combustion) is compared with the black liquor upgrading (via) gasification process for ammonia production in terms of economics, exergy efficiency and environmental impact. The combined energy integration and exergy analysis is used to identify the potential improvements that may remain hidden to the energy analysis alone, namely, the determination and mitigation of the process irreversibility. As a result, the exergy efficiencies of the conventional and the integrated cases average 40\% and 42\%, respectively, whereas the overall emission balance varies from 1.97 to -0.69 tCO2/tPulp, respectively. The negative CO2 emissions indicate the environmental benefits of the proposed integrated process compared to the conventional kraft pulp mill.},

  abstract = {The pursuit of alternative energy sources for the nitrogen fertilizers sector has recently earned renewed interest due to increasing concerns regarding the world dependence on non-renewable energy resources and also motivated by the more stringent environmental regulations. The decarbonization of this sector, responsible for 2\% of the global energy consumption, might help not only improving its carbon footprint, but also reducing its dependence on international market prices of natural gas. In order to palliate the environmental impacts that nitrogen fertilizers production is responsible for, several efforts have been addressed to incentivize the partial or total decarbonization of the ammonia supply chain. The thermochemical conversion routes of biomass can play an important role in this decarbonization process and also is an interesting opportunity to capitalize on the underexploited biomass potential in tropical countries. Thus, in this work, two production plants, nitric acid and urea, are integrated to a kraft pulp mill via black liquor gasification. The proposed systems are evaluated in light of thermodynamic and environmental aspects. The choice of the utility system has been driven by the interrelation of the market conditions, as well as the extent of the energy integration of the chemical plants. As a result, the exergy efficiency of the integrated plants remains competitive against the conventional kraft pulp mill thanks on the optimal selection of the operating conditions of the utility system. Furthermore, the results for the overall CO2 emissions balance achieved negative values for some scenarios, pointing out the potential for CO2 depletion with the integrated processes proposed. Finally, the indirect emissions of the biomass supply chain demonstrated to have a great impact in the CO2 balance.},

  abstract = {The black liquor gasification integrated to chemical plants has shown potential for reducing the process irreversibility and promoting the decarbonization of this industrial sector. In the integrated chemical plants proposed in this work, the purpose is co-producing pulp and gaseous fuels, either hydrogen or synthetic natural gas, in order to expand the biorefinery product portfolio and, consequently, increase the plant revenues. However, due to additional equipment and utility demands, along with the uncertainty about the prices of the commodities; the benefits of the integrated setups must be thoroughly weighed by considering thermodynamic, economic and environmental indicators before the retrofit of the existing configuration is implemented. The exergy method is used along with the energy integration technique and other financial indicators to determine whether and in which scenarios the integrated biorefineries would be more attractive. The average exergy efficiency of the integrated chemical production plants is 44\%, which is higher than that of the conventional case (40\%). The balance of the overall CO2 emissions vary from 1.97 to -0.56 tCO2/tPulp, for the conventional and integrated setups, respectively. An incremental financial analysis under uncertainty also shows that the hydrogen production route with partial import of electricity and carbon taxations above 60 EUR/tCO2 outperforms the other scenarios. Therefore, the import of electricity from low-carbon grids and the upgrade of biorefinery residues arise as key factors for ensuring the sustainable production of traditionally fossil-based chemicals under more stringent environmental regulations.},

A thermodynamic equilibrium modelling had been presentedfor a throated downdraft gasifier, based on equilibrium constants with appropriate assumptions. The gas compositions of the above bio-fuels had been studied with varying moisture content from (0-30) percentage at a gasification temperature of 850{$^\circ$}C. Highest calorific value (18.40MJ kg-1) was obtained for bamboo chip with fixed carbon 48.69 percentages. Gulmohar yielded maximum value of Hydrogen (24.50\%) in downdraft gasification among all fuels for same moisture. Bamboo gasification gave overall best quality of producer gas for same moisture. The compositions of producer gas thus generated from these five woody biomasses had been determined by gas chromatography analysis. The results obtained from equilibrium modelling study were fairly in good agreement with experimental results.},

Industrial operations take advantage of the reactive properties of oxygen in order to manufacture products as efficient and cost-effective as possible. Oxygen is involved in most industrial processes in which combustion or chemical reactions play a role (from steelmaking to water treatment). Distillation of air (air separation) is currently the most commonly used technique for production of pure oxygen and nitrogen on an industrial scale. In this article, energetic, exergetic and economic assessments of two columns cryogenic air separation are considered. For this purpose, a two columns cryogenic air separation unit is simulated. Then using simulation data, energetic and exergetic and economic analyses are performed. Annualized cost of system is chosen as an economic approach. Sensitivity analyses of economic parameters against utility prices and cost of product in the market are investigated. Results of exergy analysis show that the compression and distillation units with 34.48 and 52.89 percent of total exergy destruction are the main exergy destructive components respectively. It also shows that in the current economic condition, the suggested system is economically feasible in the size of 9 kg/sec O2 and more than it.},

The proposed plant is intended by reduction in the number of operating units within heat and power integration which provides significant potential for investment cost reduction. Due to the reduction in the number of plant units and also production of economically valuable intermediate streams of N2, H2, CO2 and NH3, the proposed plant provides more technical flexibility compared to the conventional technologies. Economic evaluation of the proposed plant shows a considerable rate of return and financial interest. In the different production rate, the proposed plant has a rate of return (IRR) above 28\%, while the IRR of conventional plants is almost near 20\%. Moreover, a combined process of novel and conventional plants is presented which produces urea without any by-product.},

The purification of the syngas produced was carried out using a high temperature filter unit which contains 3 rigid ceramic candles with an outer diameter of 60 mm and a length of 1500 mm. Keeping the gasification temperature in the range of 800{$^\circ$}-860{$^\circ$}C and using magnesite M85 as the bed material, the effects of operational conditions (e.g. steam to biomass ratio (SBR) and oxygen to biomass stoichiometric ratio (ER)) and of catalytic and non-catalytic filtration on the composition distribution of the product gas and tar formation were investigated. Higher temperature and SBR values were favorable for increasing the mole ratio H2 to CO and decreasing the tar compound (PAH) concentration on dry basis, measured via solid phase adsorption (SPA) sampling and subsequent GC analysis varying from approximately 2 to 6 g/mn3. At the same operational conditions, in the downstream filter, the conversion of tar content obtained using catalytic filter candles increased by a factor of 2.8 compared to the one with non-catalytic filter elements. The specification and distribution of major ash forming elements were investigated by SEM-EDS. Experimental results showed that bagasse is an interesting fuel for syngas production via the gasification process, both from a gas composition and from a tar production point of view.},

Moreover, the choice of the carbon capture unit, based on either physical or chemical absorption systems, drastically affects the way in which the waste heat recovery must be performed, and whether one or more energy technologies should or not be integrated (e.g. heat pump). Meanwhile, the selection among various energy resources, e.g. the import of electricity over the autonomous combined heat and power production (CHP), strongly depends on the ratio between the prices of electricity and fuels consumed, as well as on the extent of the energy integration. Accordingly, a simple trial and error approach falls short in efficiently determining the most suitable operating conditions that enable the production plant to run under the minimum operating cost. Thus, by using a systematic methodology, the most suitable utility systems (cooling, refrigeration, and cogeneration) that satisfy the minimum energy requirement (MER) with the lowest energy consumption and operating cost, are selected. Consequently, the conventional plant efficiency is increased about 10\% by using a mixed operating mode or autonomous operating mode with combined cycle. Furthermore, reduced cooling (23\%) and heating (51\%) requirements are expected when physical solvents are used. The lowest exergy consumption corresponds to mixed operating mode by using a physical absorption unit (27.76 GJ/tNH3). Finally, it is found that exergy efficiency drops 24\% when the irreversibility in the upstream steps of feedstock obtainment are considered.},

  abstract = {The use of biomass gasification for partially or totally replacing methane in the integrated syngas and ammonia production plant is compared with the performance of the conventional route, typically based on steam methane reforming. However, by undertaking novel designs, additional or totally different demands are created. Consequently, the optimal integration approach between the new chemical plant and the alternative utility systems must be updated, so that the power and steam requirements remain satisfied. To this end, a systematic framework that allows selecting the most suitable utility systems whereas satisfying the minimum energy requirements (MER) with lower operating cost is adopted. The combined energy integration and exergy analyses proved to be relevant, especially regarding the integration of reactive components and the combined heat and power production (CHP) as well as the reduction of avoidable exergy losses. The exergy efficiencies of the natural gas and biomass-based ammonia production plants average 65.8\% and 41.3\%, respectively, and the overall emission balances vary from 0.5 to -2.3 tCO2/tNH3, respectively. Despite the lower efficiency, higher operating revenues are achieved by totally replacing the costly natural gas input and avoiding the electricity import, favoring the consumption of a fraction of the syngas produced as fuel. Finally, it must be noticed that by defining an extended industrial framework, the inefficiencies at the upstream feedstock supply chains can be also accounted for, which entails a further reduction of 10--15\% of the overall ammonia production efficiency. Accordingly, even by fully substituting the natural gas consumption with renewable energy resources, the sustainability of the overall system becomes rather an intricate function of the performance of the feedstock supply chains, the electricity mix enclosing the chemical system, the ammonia production plant and the main components thereof, as well as of the cost ratio of the resources consumed.},

Batch experiments were performed with wood residue crushed into three different sizes of 0.5--1mm (small), 1--2.5mm (medium), and 2.5--5mm (large), at reactor temperatures of 700, 800, and 900{$^\circ$}C. As the steam/biomass ratio increases, a decrease in formation of CO, accompanied by an increase in the hydrogen concentration, is observed. As expected, an increase in reactor temperature leads to a significant increase of H2 output and tar reforming. The obtained results show that hydrogen yield increases as time duration of the experiment is increased. It is also found that a reduction in particle diameter leads to a significant improvement in hydrogen yield.},

The model calculates the relative quantities of gasification products and the lower heating value of the syngas.

We present a robust successive substitution method that solves the multiphase Rachford-Rice equations sequentially using the method of bi-section while considering the monotonicity of the equations and the locations of singular hyperplanes. Although this method is slower than Newton solution, as it does not rely on Jacobians that can become poorly conditioned, it can be inserted into Newton iterations upon the detection of a poorly conditioned Jacobian. Testing shows that embedded successive substitution steps effectively improved the robustness. The benefit of the Newton method in the speed of convergence is maintained.},

  abstract = {Soybean straw is an agricultural residue of soybean whose yield is up to 1.5~kg per kg of soybean. The existing literature shows the vast potential of soybean straw as an environmentally friendly carbon source to produce value-added chemicals, materials, fuels, and energy in a similar way to oil refineries. However, the use of this biomass on a commercial scale in biorefineries still faces some challenges. This comprehensive review discusses the available literature in several topics related to the application of this agricultural residue, such as productive potential; quality of feedstock; feedstock delivery; challenges in the breakdown of the cell wall polymeric structure; conversion process into chemicals, heat, and power; and the production of advanced materials. Several examples of fiber treatment are presented to demonstrate the potential of taking advantage of the mechanical properties of soybean straw. Current knowledge gaps and challenges related to the conversion of soybean straw to fermentable sugars and the low performance of hydrolysate fermentation are discussed, besides other applications in the sugar platform. Thermochemical conversion is discussed as well because of the possibility of readily employing this biomass in co-processing plants. In the end, an outlook of potential directions for future research towards the next generation of integrated soybean/soybean straw biorefinery is presented to demonstrate the potential of further developing applications for this biomass.},

  abstract = {Due to rapid industrialization and urban development across the globe, the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been significantly increased, resulting in adverse effects on the climate and ecosystems. In this regard, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered to be a promising technology in reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration. Among the CO2 capture technologies, adsorption has grabbed significant attention owing to its advantageous characteristics discovered in recent years. Porous carbon-based materials have emerged as one of the most versatile CO2 adsorbents. Numerous research activities have been conducted by synthesizing carbon-based adsorbents using different precursors to investigate their performances towards CCS. Additionally, amine-functionalized carbon-based adsorbents have exhibited remarkable potential for selective capturing of CO2 in the presence of other gases and humidity conditions. The present review describes the CO2 emission sources, health, and environmental impacts of CO2 towards the human beings, options for CCS, and different CO2 separation technologies. Apart from the above, different synthesis routes of carbon-based adsorbents using various precursors have been elucidated. The CO2 adsorption selectivity, capacity, and reusability of the current and applied carbon materials have also been summarized. Furthermore, the critical factors controlling the adsorption performance (e.g., the effect of textural and functional properties) are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future research directions have also been summarized.},

  abstract = {The paper presents an energy performance assessment of CO2 removal for crude synthetic natural gas (SNG) upgrade by Selexol absorption process. A simplified process simulation of the Selexol process concerning power requirement and separation performance was developed. The assessment indicates that less pressure difference between crude SNG and absorption pressure favors the energy performance of CO2 removal process. When both crude SNG and absorption pressures are 20 bar, CO2 removal process has the best energy performance. The optimal specific power consumption of the CO2 removal process is 566 kJ/kgCO2. The sensitivity analysis shows that the CO2 removal efficiency would significantly influence the total power consumption of the removal process, as well as higher heating value (HHV) and CO2 content in SNG. However, the specific power consumption excluding crude SNG and SNG compressions changes little with the variance of CO2 removal efficiency. If by-product CO2 is compressed for CO2 capture, the process would turn into a CO2-sink for the atmosphere. Correspondingly, an increase of 281 kJ/kgCO2 in specific power consumption is required for compressing the separated CO2.},

The most widely used design for this process involves two distillation columns operating at different pressures. This work focuses on the selection of suitable cryogenic air separation process by evaluating seven alternative designs of the two-column air separation process based on detailed exergy analysis. The feed conditions (500 tons/h, and 50\% relative humidity of air), product purities (99 mole\% for both nitrogen and oxygen), and operational conditions (pressures of both distillation columns) are kept same in all designs. The two cryogenic distillation columns in each configuration are heat-integrated to eliminate the need for external utilities. Steady-state simulation results are used to calculate the exergy efficiency (\%) of each equipment as well as its contribution toward the overall exergy destruction rate (kW) of the process. The results show that the compression section is a major source of exergy destruction, followed by the low-pressure column, and the multi-stream heat exchanger. A Petlyuk-like configuration, labeled as C1, provides the lowest exergy destruction rate.},

In an introductory chapter on numerical methods and their relevance to computing, well-known mathematician Richard Hamming ("the Hamming code," "the Hamming distance," and "Hamming window," etc.), suggests that the purpose of computing is insight, not merely numbers. In that connection he outlines five main ideas that aim at producing meaningful numbers that will be read and used, but will also lead to greater understanding of how the choice of a particular formula or algorithm influences not only the computing but our understanding of the results obtained.The five main ideas involve (1) insuring that in computing there is an intimate connection between the source of the problem and the usability of the answers (2) avoiding isolated formulas and algorithms in favor of a systematic study of alternate ways of doing the problem (3) avoidance of roundoff (4) overcoming the problem of truncation error (5) insuring the stability of a feedback system.In this second edition, Professor Hamming (Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California) extensively rearranged, rewrote and enlarged the material. Moreover, this book is unique in its emphasis on the frequency approach and its use in the solution of problems. Contents include:I. Fundamentals and AlgorithmsII. Polynomial Approximation- Classical TheoryIll. Fourier Approximation- Modern TheoryIV. Exponential Approximation ... and moreHighly regarded by experts in the field, this is a book with unlimited applications for undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics, science and engineering.

  abstract = {The metal(loid)-enriched Avicennia marina biomass obtained from phytoremediation was impregnated with two ferric salts (FeCl3 and Fe(NO3)3) prior to pyrolysis at 300--700~{$^\circ$}C, aiming to study the influence on pyrolytic product properties and heavy metal(loid) deportment. Results showed that the impregnated ferric salts increased the fixed carbon content of biochars, hydrocarbon fractions in bio-oils, and the evolution of CO and H2 in gases. Cd in biomass could be effectively removed from the biomass by FeCl3 impregnation. During pyrolysis, the ferric salts enhanced the elemental recovery of As, Cr, Ni and Pb in the biochars and decreased their distribution in gases. Notably, the ferric salt pre-treatment inhibited the mobility and bio-availability of most elements in the biochars. This study indicated that ferric salt impregnation catalysed the pyrolysis process of metal(loid) contaminated biomass, enabled the operation temperature at 500--700~{$^\circ$}C with minimal environmental risks, providing a safe and value-added way to the phytoremediation-pyrolysis scheme.},

The experiments demonstrated that both CO and CO2 are formed as primary products, and the rate of methane disappearance is proportional to the partial pressure of methane at low product concentrations. The effect of total pressure on initial reaction rates indicated that the rate controlling steps of steam reforming are surface reactions between adsorbed species. Six possible reaction mechanisms were considered in detail, and intrinsic rate equations were derived by using the Langmuir--Hinshelwood--Hougen--Watson (LH--HW) approach and Freundlich's adsorption concept. Applying the method of parameter estimation and model discrimination, a satisfactory model of intrinsic kinetics for methane steam reforming over the catalyst used was determined. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental data and results predicted from the kinetic model.},

Experiments are performed in a downdraft gasifier by varying the operation parameters of the particle size (60 mesh, 80 mesh, 100 mesh), temperature point (700, 750, 800, 850, 900{$^\circ$}C), and steam-to-biomass mass (S/B) ratio (0, 0.7, 1.4, 2.1, 2.8). The main effects of particle size, temperature, and S/B ratio on the composition of the product gas are analyzed to predict the optimal operation parameters of biomass feedstock. For pine woodchip gasification, the optimal particle size is 80 mesh or 0.17 mm, the preferred temperature is 850{$^\circ$}C, and the optimal S/B ratio is 1.4. Although there is an error between the experiment and the simulation, the difference is not significant. The Aspen Plus model can provide guidance for the gasification of pine woodchips and can be extended to the gasification of other kinds of biomass. The main effects of particle size, temperature, and S/B ratio on the composition of the product gas are analyzed to predict the optimal operation parameters of biomass feedstock.

A study of the effect of two variables-ER ratio (defined as the ratio between the air flow introduced into the gasifier and the air stoichiometric flow required for complete combustion of the bagasse) and reaction temperature-on the product distribution (syngas, bio-tar and char) and syngas composition have been analyzed. The ER ratio has a positive effect on gas production, increasing production when a higher ER is used. The char yield decreased at higher temperatures and yield of bio-tar remained almost invariant regardless the value of ER. The amount of bio-tar in the syngas was very small, but it was found that the bio-tar was almost water ({$>$} 95 wt\% of water). The highest ER promoted the production of larger quantities of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, while reducing the amount of carbon dioxide.},

Thermo-chemical conversion technologies including gasification, co-firing, and pyrolysis are of primary interest due to their higher conversion efficiency and throughput when compared with the low temperature digestion and fermentation for lignocellulose and wood-based feedstock. In this paper, a small scale, air blown, downdraft gasification system is operated using wood to investigate its conversion efficiency. Wood chips of 0.5cm thickness, 1--2cm width, and 2--2.5cm length constitute the feedstock to the downdraft gasifier that is assembled and instrumented at Masdar Institute's Waste-to-Energy laboratory. The experimental investigation of the temperature field inside the gasifier is followed by high fidelity numerical simulation using CFD to model the Lagrangian particle coupled evolution. The numerical simulation is conducted on a high resolution mesh accounting for the solid and gaseous phases, k--{$\varepsilon$} turbulence, and reacting CFD model. The temperature distribution and the evolution of species are computed and compared with the experimental results and with the ideal equilibrium, zero dimensional case.},

  abstract = {The management of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the current status of world energy resources crisis are important problems. Gasification is a kind of waste-to- energy conversion scheme that offers the most attractive solution to both waste disposal and energy problems. In this study, the thermodynamic equilibrium model based on equilibrium constant for predicting the composition of producer gas in a downdraft waste gasifier was developed. To enhance the performance of the model, further modification was made by multiplying the equilibrium constants with coefficients. The modified model was validated with the data reported by different researchers. MSW in Thailand was then used to simulate and to study the effects of moisture content (MC) of the waste on the gasifier's performance. The results showed that the mole fraction of H2 gradually increases; CO decreases; CH4, which has a very low percentage in the producer gas increases; N2 slightly decreases; and CO2 increases with increasing MC. The reaction temperature, the calorific value, and the second law efficiency, decrease when MC increases.},

Experimental testing of the design under various conditions has produced data that has then been used to calibrate a computer program, developed to investigate the impact of those parameters and features on conversion efficiency. The program consists of two sub-models of the pyrolysis and gasification zones, respectively. The pyrolysis sub-model has been used to determine the maximum temperature and the composition of the gas entering the gasification zone. The gasification zone sub-model has been calibrated using data gathered from the experiments. It was found that a wood chip size of 3--5cm with a moisture content below 15\% (d.b.) should be used in this gasifier. Feed material with a fixed carbon content of higher than 30\% and heat losses of more than 15\% should be avoided. For the above parameters, the gasification zone should be 33cm long to achieve an acceptable conversion efficiency.},

  abstract = {Biomass feedstock can be used for the production of biofuels or biobased chemicals to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Earlier studies about the techno-economic performance of biofuel or biobased chemical production varied in biomass feedstock, conversion process, and other techno-economic assumptions. This made a fair comparison between different industrial processing pathways difficult. The aim of this study is to quantify uniformly the factory-gate production costs and the GHG emission intensity of biobased ethanol, ethylene, 1,3-propanediol (PDO), and succinic acid, and to compare them with each other and their respective fossil equivalent products. Brazilian sugarcane and eucalyptus are used as biomass feedstock in this study. A uniform approach is applied to determine the production costs and GHG emission intensity of biobased products, taking into account feedstock supply, biobased product yield, capital investment, energy, labor, maintenance, and processing inputs. Economic performance and net avoided GHG emissions of biobased chemicals depend on various uncertain factors, so this study pays particular attention to uncertainty by means of a Monte Carlo analysis. A sensitivity analysis is also performed. As there is uncertainty associated with the parameters used for biobased product yield, feedstock cost, fixed capital investment, industrial scale, and energy costs, the results are presented in ranges. The 60\% confidence interval ranges of the biobased product production costs are 0.64--1.10 US{\textbackslash} kg-1 ethanol, 1.18--2.05 US{\textbackslash} kg-1 ethylene, 1.37--2.40 US{\textbackslash} kg-1 1,3-PDO, and 1.91--2.57 US{\textbackslash} kg-1 succinic acid. The cost ranges of all biobased products partly or completely overlap with the ranges of the production costs of the fossil equivalent products. The results show that sugarcane-based 1,3-PDO and to a lesser extent succinic acid have the highest potential benefit. The ranges of GHG emission reduction are 1.29--2.16, 3.37--4.12, 2.54--5.91, and 0.47--5.22 CO2eq kg-1 biobased product for ethanol, ethylene, 1,3-PDO, and succinic acid respectively. Considering the potential GHG emission reduction and profit per hectare, the pathways using sugarcane score are generally better than eucalyptus feedstock due to the high yield of sugarcane in Brazil. Overall, it was not possible to choose a clear winner, (a) because the best performing biobased product strongly depends on the chosen metric, and (b) because of the large ranges found, especially for PDO and succinic acid, independent of the chosen metric. To quantify the performance better, more data are required regarding the biobased product yield, equipment costs, and energy consumption of biobased industrial pathways, but also about the production costs and GHG emission intensity of fossil-equivalent products. {\copyright} 2019 The Authors.

Among these strategies, machine learning (ML) has attracted substantial interest in recent years in thermochemical conversion process optimization, yield prediction, real-time monitoring, and process control. This study presents a comprehensive review of the research and development in state-of-the-art ML applications in pyrolysis, torrefaction, hydrothermal treatment, gasification, and combustion. Artificial neural networks have been widely employed due to their ability to learn extremely non-linear input--output correlations. Furthermore, the hybrid ML models outperformed the traditional ML models in modeling and optimization tasks. The comparison between various ML methods for different applications, and insights about where the current research is heading, is highlighted. Finally, based on the critical analysis, existing research knowledge gaps are identified, and future recommendations are presented.},

A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model has been formulated and implemented in a commercial software package (GAMS) using databases built in Excel. The MILP represents decisions regarding (1) the optimal number, locations, and sizes of various types of processing plants, (2) the amounts of biomass, intermediate products, and final products to be transported between the selected locations over a selected period, and maximizes the objective function of overall profit. The model has been tested based on an industry-representative data set that contains information on the existing wood resources, final product market locations and demands, and candidate locations and sizes for different types of processing plants, as well as the costs associated with the various processing units and transportation of materials, covering the Southeastern region of the United States. The model is applied to design both a distributed, and a more centralized, conversion system. The overall profits, values, cost, and supply network designs of both systems are analyzed using the optimization model. In particular, we investigate: 1) which parameters have major effect on the overall economics, and 2) the benefits of going to more distributed types of processing networks, in terms of the overall economics and the robustness to demand variations.},

  abstract = {Biomass resources have the potential to become a viable renewable technology and play a key role within the future renewable energy paradigm. Since CO2 generated in bio-energy production is equal to the CO2 absorbed during the growth of the biomass, this renewable energy is a net zero emissions resource. Biomass gasification is a versatile method for transforming waste into energy in which biomass material is thermochemically converted within a reactor. Gasification's superior flexibility, including both in terms of biomass type and heat generation or energy production alternatives, is what stimulates biomass gasification scientific and industrial potential. Downdraft gasifiers seem to be well-suited for small-scale generation of heat along with energy, whereas fluidised bed and entrained flow gasifiers currently attain significant economies of scale for fuel production. The operation of gasifiers is influenced by several factors, including operational parameters, feedstock types, and reactor design. Modelling is a valuable tool for building a unit based on the results of model predictions with different operational parameters and feedstock in such scenarios. Once verified, a suitable model may be used to assess the sensitivity of a gasifier's performance to changes in various operational and design factors. Effective models may help designers to theorise and predict the impacts of a variety of characteristics without the need for further empirical observations, which can help in the design and implementation of this technology. This work provides an overview of gasification technologies and a succinct guidance to the modelling decisions and modelling strategies for biomass gasification to enable a successful biomass to fuel conversion. A technical description and critical analysis of thermodynamic, kinetic, computational fluid dynamic and data-driven approaches is provided, including crucial modelling considerations that have not been explored in earlier studies. The review aims to aid researchers in the field to select the appropriate approach and guide future work.},

  abstract = {Worldwide escalating energy consumption of recent years, due to the earth population growth and the spreading of industrialization, has resulted in an increased concern about the environmental impact of energy conversion systems. Heavy exploitation and extensive use of fossil fuels have indeed also led to envisage their foreseeable depletion, thus opening the way to the use of alternative fuels as biomass. Among thermo-chemical treatments of biomass, gasification is particularly attractive for its release of syngas (or producer gas), suitable of being used in various combustion systems, including internal combustion engines. In principle, biomass contaminants and heavy hydrocarbons can be removed during syngas cleaning, before the actual combustion process, thus leading to an overall cleaner conversion process. At present, demonstrating operational feasibility and effectiveness of gasification technologies and proving long term sustainability, also through the enhancement of fuel flexibility, are recognized as key elements for the development and market diffusion of biomass energy systems. In fact, although gasification has been known for a long time, its control has long requested serious efforts by researchers and manufacturers. Nowadays, new perspectives are imaginable thanks to the use of simulation tools that may reveal particularly useful to improve gasification efficiency and increase the quality of the producer gas.},

This paper presents the simulation of monoethanolamine (MEA) based CO2 capture and compression process integrated within a 600MWe supercritical coal-fired power plant using chemical process simulators. Comparison between bi-pressure stripper and single-pressure stripper reveals that improved CO2 capture system with bi-pressure stripper minimizes energy penalty of CO2 capture and compression by up to 6.3\% at full unit load. The study also explores optimization of some important process parameters affecting the performance of coal-fired power plant by taking into account both CO2 capture process and CO2 compression at full unit load. These parameters include operating stripper pressure, CO2 capture efficiency and steam extraction location. Results show that the optimal stripper pressure is within the range of 1.9--2.1bar and feasible CO2 capture efficiency is between 60\% and 90\%. Results also show that low-pressure steam extraction reduces energy penalty. Evaluation of improved CO2 capture system is also performed at part flue gas load ranging from 40\% to 90\%. The study reveals that operating at part flue gas load, as compared with full load, increases energy penalty of carbon capture. Not only energy penalty but also lean solution flow rate and plant efficiency are studied at different flue load levels in this paper. In addition, results show that bi-pressure stripper configuration is also effective in reducing energy penalty at part unit load.},

From this perspective, the discussion on carbon capture focuses on chemical absorption technology, primarily due to its commercialization potential. The CO2 absorptive capacity and absorption rate of various chemical solvents have been summarized. The carbon utilization focuses on electrochemical conversion routes converting CO2 into potentially valuable chemicals which have received particular attention in recent years. The Faradaic conversion efficiencies for various CO2 reduction products are used to describe efficiency improvements. For carbon storage, successful deployment relies on a better understanding of fluid mechanics, geomechanics, and reactive transport, which are discussed in details.},

  abstract = {Rachford--Rice iterations are widely used in equation-of-state (EOS) flash calculations to determine phase equilibrium compositions from constant equilibrium ratios (K-values). The method, however, can be slow to converge or may not converge at all for cases where at least one overall composition is zero or negative. Having a robust method for flash calculations in these special cases is important in calculating the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) using method of characteristics (MOC). This paper presents a simple, fast, and robust alternative to Rachford--Rice and similar methods in flash calculations, whether overall compositions are positive, zero, or negative. The new objective function has two fewer asymptotes compared to Rachford--Rice and is based on solving for one of the equilibrium phase mole fractions, typically the lightest component. Results with the new objective function demonstrate that rapid convergence using Newton--Raphson (NR) iterations is assured because the correct solution is determined within a small range (window). In that window, no poles exist no matter the overall composition and the objective function is often nearly linear.

  abstract = {N-(2-Hydroxyethyl) piperazine (HEPZ) has a chemical structure similar to PZ and has less volatility. It is not easy to volatilize in a continuous operation device. It is studied to replace PZ as a promotor to increase the CO2 capture rate. This paper researches the lowest energy consumption and absorbent loss of HEPZ/H2O in the absorption-regeneration process, and compares it with another five amines, including PZ, MEA, 1-MPZ, AMP and DMEA. Based on the thermodynamic model, this work establishes a process simulation based on the equilibrium stage, assuming that all stages of the absorption and desorption towers reach thermodynamic equilibrium and CO2 recovery in the absorption tower is 90\%. By optimizing the process parameters, the lowest thermodynamic energy consumption and absorbent loss of process operation are obtained. Our results show that HEPZ as a promotor to replace PZ and MEA has significant economic value. The lowest reboiler energy consumption of HEPZ with the optimal process parameters is 3.018 GJ/tCO2, which is about 35.2\% lower than that of PZ and about 11.6\% lower than that of MEA, and HEPZ has the lowest solvent loss. The cyclic capacity is 64.7\% higher than PZ and 21.6\% lower than primary amine MEA.},

The process model of the gasification, ammonia and urea synthesis was developed in Aspen Plus{\dbend} to identify key performance indicators such as energy consumption and relative yields for urea for different biomasses and operating conditions; then, these key process data were used in a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, designed to identify the optimal combination of energy source, technological route of urea production and plant location that maximizes the net present value of the system. The model was applied to the whole Brazilian territory, divided into 5569 cities and 558 micro-regions. Each region{\dbend}s agricultural production was evaluated to estimate biomass supply and urea demand. The Assis microregion, in close proximity with sugarcane and soybean crops, was found to be an optimal location for the plant, with an NPV of 110 MMUSD. Urea demand was found to be the main limiting factor, with more than 30 microregions needed to consume the plant{\dbend}s production. The results indicate the feasibility of producing renewable urea from agricultural waste and the importance of considering a two-level approach to assess the economic performance of the entire system.},

Policymakers tend to use the carbon price as an indicator of the ``health'' and effectiveness of the ETS mechanism, although this measure is influenced by many other energy and climate policies, energy market fundamentals, and speculative shocks. This paper develops a model that links the energy sector (oil, natural gas, coal, electricity prices, and the share of fossil fuels in electricity generation), economic activity, and the carbon price. The model can be used as a monitoring tool for carbon price dynamics. We represent the model empirically through a Structural Vector Autoregression and use frequency-domain analysis to distinguish the effects of changes in fundamental factors from shocks to market microstructure. Our empirical results show that up to 90\% (65\% on average) of the fluctuations in the carbon price, adjusted for supply effects, are explained by fluctuations in fundamental market variables; however, the individual contributions are not stable. Overall, our results suggest that the ETS has started to work well.},

  abstract = {Due to its capability to produce negative CO2 emissions, bioenergy in combination with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been identified as a key technology to limit global warming and to support the energy transition in pursue of the climate targets of this century. Among different bioenergy applications, advanced liquid biofuels produced through the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste biomass have gained interest as promising drop-in alternatives to fossil fuels. However, there is lack of studies in literature that evaluate the potential of HTL as negative emission technology in the context of BECCS and present detailed process design of such an implementation for different types of biomass. In this paper, we perform carbon capture modeling based on state-of-art experimental data on HTL of waste lignocellulosic and urban biomasses by means of physical absorption via the Selexol™ process. The process model is utilized for developing a techno-economic analysis that highlights key parameters to optimize CO2 capture cost efficiency. The results indicate that the purity of the CO2 product fulfils the requirements for geological storage in all cases studied, and is on-spec for pipeline transportation when the composition of C2+ hydrocarbons and H2S in the HTL gas are kept below 4 and 1 mol \% respectively, or by the implementation of two absorption steps. For the standard process evaluated, the estimated cost of the captured CO2 is between 40 and 53 EUR/tonne, which is in the range of the carbon price expected within this decade in the EU emission trading system, given the announced cap reductions until 2030 and the targets set by the European Green Deal.},

Since then, similar expert surveys have been  carried out and published every two to four years in the main  fertilizer-consuming countries. Since 2008 IFA has led these efforts and,  to our knowledge, remains the only globally available data set on FUBC.  This dataset includes data (in CSV format) from a survey carried out by  IFA to represent the 2017--18 period as well as a collation of all historic  FUBC data.},

  abstract = {Biomass gasification is an important method to obtain renewable hydrogen. However, this technology still stagnates in a laboratory scale because of its high-energy consumption. In order to get maximum hydrogen yield and decrease energy consumption, this study applies a self-heated downdraft gasifier as the reactor and uses char as the catalyst to study the characteristics of hydrogen production from biomass gasification. Air and oxygen/steam are utilized as the gasifying agents. The experimental results indicate that compared to biomass air gasification, biomass oxygen/steam gasification improves hydrogen yield depending on the volume of downdraft gasifier, and also nearly doubles the heating value of fuel gas. The maximum lower heating value of fuel gas reaches 11.11 MJ/ N m3 for biomass oxygen/steam gasification. Over the ranges of operating conditions examined, the maximum hydrogen yield reaches 45.16 g H2/kg biomass. For biomass oxygen/steam gasification, the content of H2 and CO reaches 63.27--72.56\%, while the content of H2 and CO gets to 52.19--63.31\% for biomass air gasification. The ratio of H2/CO for biomass oxygen/steam gasification reaches 0.70--0.90, which is lower than that of biomass air gasification, 1.06--1.27. The experimental and comparison results prove that biomass oxygen/steam gasification in a downdraft gasifier is an effective, relatively low energy consumption technology for hydrogen-rich gas production.},

More in detail, the design optimization procedure enables the simultaneous optimization of process, utility design, and heat integration, and takes account all of the interactions with the rest of the plant. The multi-objective optimization is carried out with a two-stage approach combining the NSGA-II genetic algorithm with the efficient direct-search method PGS-COM. Results show that in the Selexol{\textregistered} process is crucial to optimize the pressures of the flash cascade releasing the CO2-rich stream to store, because the largest energy penalties are the compression power and the steam necessary for reboiling.},

The sugar industry has the potential to generate about 960~MW per year from bagasse based on the average of 20 million tons of sugar cane crushed per year. Renewable energy sources like bagasse are generally regarded as cleaner energy sources as opposed to coal-derived energy. However, the environmental benefits of power production from bagasse must be verified using a systematic scientific methodology. This study develops the life cycle inventories for bagasse power production in South Africa. The life cycle inventory can help to evaluate the environmental impacts of the cogeneration throughout the life cycle. The data for this inventory stage of the research was supplied by the sugar industry, and the analysis mostly uses South African data in the inventory stage. The study presents life cycle inventories based on a functional unit of 1~GWh of bagasse-derived electricity produced in the South African sugar industry. A comparison of the current generating output with a proposed higher output shows that more energy can be produced in addition to reduced inventory levels and this has the potential to improve environmental performance of bagasse power generation in South Africa.},

  abstract = {Two new water-soluble cellulose derivatives were prepared by a two-step transformation with 1,3-propane sultone, followed by either maleic or succinic anhydride, thereby converting cellulose into a more easily processable form. It was found that the solubility was dependent on both the degree of substitution and the chemical properties of the substituents. The water-soluble cellulose has a molecular weight greater than 100 000 g mol-1 and both the morphology and molecular weight can be tuned by varying the reaction conditions. Furthermore, the flexible, two-step nature of the process allows for expansion of this methodology in order to prepare cellulose analogues for different applications.},

  abstract = {Fortran remains one of the principal programming languages used in high-performance scientific, numerical, and engineering computing. A series of significant revisions to the standard versions of the language have progressively enhanced its capabilities, and the current standard - Fortran 2023 - brings with it further additions and improvements. The language as defined by its most recent standards, with their introduction of object-oriented programming and of coarrays, is often referred to generically as 'Modern Fortran', and this term is increasingly used in the literature.Thus, we see that Fortran's particular advantages as a high-end numerical language, especially where arrays are the main form of data object and/or where complex arithmetic is involved, are still to the fore. It is able to attain the highest achievable optimization, mainly because multi-dimensional arrays are 'natural' objects and because its pointers are highly constrained. There is every sign that Modern Fortran will continue to be used to tackle major scientific computing problems in the next decade and beyond and will long remain a living tribute to its early pioneers. This third edition of Modern Fortran Explained expands on the second. The material contained in the four final chapters of the second edition have been merged into the main text, thereby offering, in 20 chapters, a comprehensive and uniform description of Fortran 2018. The additional features now brought by the 2023 standard, which are mostly relatively minor in nature, are described in two final chapters, the first on generic programming and the second on the other features. This structure enables the reader to distinguish clearly between what is old and what is new.This new edition, written by experts in the field, three of whom have actively contributed to Fortran 2023, is thus a complete and authoritative description of Fortran in its latest form, with the intention that it remain the main reference work in the field.},

The other method is the secant variant of BNS. Numerical examples presented in this paper indicate that the new methods converge rapidly and monotonically to the correct root. All the methods are compared and their convergence properties are illustrated on three examples. The methods are also tested on a large set of input data from the Rachford--Rice contest database.},

One alternative to reducing these effects is to integrate production processes. This study compares the cumulative environmental performance of individual production routes for ethanol, urea, and acetic acid with that of an integrated complex designed based on Industrial Ecology precepts. Life Cycle Assessment was used as a metric for the impact categories of Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Primary Energy Demand (PED). The comparison occurred between the reference scenario, which considers individual processes, and six alternative integrated arrangements that vary in the treatment given to a stream concentrated in fuels generated in the Carbon Capture and Usage system that serves the processing of acetic acid. The study showed that process integration is recommended in terms of PED, whose contributions were reduced by 46--63\% compared to stand-alone processes. The impacts of GWP are associated with treating the fuel stream. If it is treated as a co-product and environmental loads are allocated in terms of energy content, gains of up to 44\% can be expected. On the other hand, if the stream is a waste, the complex's GWP becomes more aggressive than the baseline scenario by 66\%.},

  abstract = {Multiphase flash calculations are crucial in compositional and thermal simulations for complex fluid systems in which three phases may co-exist. Solution of the Richford-Rice system of equations is an important operation in the multiphase flash. Within the literature, solution methods have been proposed, based on optimization methods and on nonlinear equation solution methods. Many methods in these two approaches may fail if the initial estimate is too inaccurate, and may require a substantial amount of computation only to arrive at a trivial solution in cases where the assumed number of phases is too high. The present work deals with an initialization method for the solution of the Rachford-Rice system of equations based on approximating each of the functions by means of tangent lines. It is proposed to solve the system of equations by applying a two-step Newton-type method. Through extensive numerical experimentation, the efficiency, robustness and reliability of the proposed initialization method for the solution of the Rachford-Rice system of equations by means of a Newton-type method is shown.},

Through extensive numerical experimentation, it is shown that the best way to solve the three analyzed forms is through a hybrid bracketing derivative free method, since the solution interval is known.

  abstract = {Tropical crops are an important source of wealth in many countries. The current agribusiness model is based on the production of a final commodity, leading to the production of organic by-products (biowastes) that in many cases contain bioactive compounds with a potential added value. The exploitation of these by-products is the foundation of the circular economy that leads to the generation of greener bioprocesses for the industry with foreseeable economic improvements in production systems. This review aims to point out the idle opportunities of agricultural production systems and their associated biowastes to contribute to the establishment of a bioeconomy. Hence, the focus lies on five tropical extensive crops: coffee, oil palm, sugar cane, banana, and pineapple. This first part of the review explores agricultural wastes originated from the coffee and oil palm industrial process and is oriented on the potential use of these by-products as a starting material for the alternative obtention of chemicals, otherwise obtained from petrochemistry. The second part of the review focuses on prospective use of lignocellulosic rich biowaste that is derived from the industrialization of sugar cane, banana, and pineapple. A fundamental difference for the use of coffee biomass compared to other crops is the presence of numerous bioactive compounds that are not yet properly utilized, such as antioxidants (i.e., caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid), as well as their possible use in the manufacture of products of interest in the cosmetic (i.e., quinic acid) or pharmaceutical industry (i.e., caffeic acid phenethyl ester). In the case of oil palm, its potential lies in obtaining chemicals such as glycerol and carotenoids, or in the bioenergy production.},

The model was implemented in Aspen Hysys{\textregistered} at the corresponding operating conditions of the facility. Initially, the reliability of the model was verified by comparison with data reported in the plant manual (EDM) from the base operating point. An additional validation was per\- formed by comparison with historical records which involved a statistical analysis of plant metadata. The model showed good agreement with both sets of data, displaying deviations {$<$} 10\%, and it was used to identify that compressors (1325 kW), multichannel heat exchanger (519 kW) and the high-pressure column (448 kW) exhibit the largest exergy destruction rates. By mean of a sensitivity analysis, main controlled variables affecting the process performance were identified. This enabled to detect the feasible operating zones, and a local minimum of exergy destruction for each variable. The overall exergy efficiency was estimated in 0.18, and the specific power consumption with respect to produced oxygen was 1.26 kWh/Nm3 O2. Results indicate that plant performance needs to be highly improved to reduce energy intensity and that the obtained model is suitable for further optimization.},

  abstract = {The Rachford--Rice equation must be solved in an inner loop of flash calculations. It consists in a sum of hyperbolas, and the desired root is located between two asymptotes which define the negative flash window. First, a simple procedure to remove the adjacent poles by changing the variable is proposed. Then, a class of convex transformations is identified, and several elementary functions that respect the general convexity condition are recognized. A new extremely simple solution window is proposed (depending only on compositions of the lightest and heaviest components), as well as an initialization procedure. Based on several convex formulations, two solution algorithms are proposed, based on the selection of the appropriate convex function (such that the monotonic convexity condition is fulfilled), and several Newton methods (including higher order) can be used without any control (it is guaranteed that an overshoot of the solution cannot occur). The transformations to make the functions convex within the search region, enable the use of Newton-type updates without the need for bounds checking and interval reduction lead to significant increase in speed of solution. The proposed algorithms are simple, very easy to implement, robust and rapid; as shown by various test examples (for selected very difficult cases and for a very large number of randomly generated flashes), only few iterations are required for convergence and the proposed method compares favorably to previous solution methods.},

Four ASPEN PLUS reactor models and external FORTRAN subroutines for hydrodynamics and kinetics nested in ASPEN PLUS simulate the gasification process. Different sets of operating conditions for a lab-scale pine gasifier are used to demonstrate validation of the model. Temperature increases the production of hydrogen and enhances carbon conversion efficiency. Equivalence ratio is directly proportional to carbon dioxide production and carbon conversion efficiency. Increasing steam-to-biomass ratio increases hydrogen and carbon monoxide production and decreases carbon dioxide and carbon conversion efficiency. Particle average size in the range of 0.25--0.75mm does not seem to contribute significantly to the composition of product gases.},

Building and improving the carbon trading market has become the focus, among which the prediction of carbon emissions trading prices is crucial. However, randomness and instability make it a challenging task to predict price series accurately. To obtain accurate point prediction results, a combined prediction idea is constructed in the study. In addition, considering that the point prediction framework contains less data information, in order to bridge this gap, an interval prediction frame is developed in this research. The optimal distribution of data sequence is obtained by using distribution function and optimization techniques, and successfully achieve different levels of uncertainty prediction according to the point prediction results. Several comparison experiments were carried out using the daily price of carbon emission futures of the European Union Emissions Trading System and the forecasting performance of the proposed forecasting framework was verified through experimental analysis. Experiments and discussion demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed prediction scheme and its excellent forecasting ability for carbon emissions trading price prediction.},

Once considered a resource intensive alternative pathway to achieve the same biofuel, second-generation approaches can now provide an economic advantage due to their potentially lower carbon footprint. The exploration of lignocellulosic harvest residues to this end can be beneficial, since productivity can be increased while not expanding cultivated areas. Eucalyptus forest residues are an example, result of logging and harvest procedures, being a low-cost and readily available biomass. Through an integrated biorefinery process simulation and a Life Cycle Assessment of the coproduction of ethanol and electricity, it was analyzed whether forestry burden is truly relevant when exploring this material, identifying technical and environmental bottlenecks. The biorefinery design implementation of anaerobic digestion and energy integration allowed a productivity boost of 20\% for ethanol and 115\% for electricity. With a 80~km collection radius, an annual production capacity of 30.3~ML could be achieved in the Campinas region. Enzymes were identified as the main environmental hotspot, but inconsistent published datasets and lack of transparency lead to inconclusive results regarding this input. While the burden associated with the lignocellulosic feedstock is relevant in most impact categories, the main bottleneck resides within the biorefinery itself, with inputs related to pretreatment and hydrolysis, boiler emissions and water consumption. Nevertheless, eucalyptus harvest residues cannot be considered a burden-free resource, since additional operations such as retrieval and transportation cannot be dismissed and often surpasses the impact potential of the aforementioned forestry activities.},

This correct solution to the RR equations is formulated as a minimization of the nonmonotonic convex function using the independent variables of (NP--1) phase mole fractions. The key to obtaining a robust algorithm is that we specify nonnegative constraints for the resulting equilibrium phase compositions, which are described by a very small region with no poles. The minimization uses Newton's direction with a line-search technique to exhibit superlinear convergence. We show a case in which a previously developed method cannot converge while our algorithm rapidly converges in a few iterations. We implement the algorithm both in a standalone flash code and in UTCOMP (Chang et al. 1990), a multiphase compositional simulator, and show that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge when a multiphase region exists as indicated by stability analysis.},

  abstract = {The production of fertilizers has been evolving steadily in the last 300 years. It involves a high number of commodities and reagents that share a large portion of the costs and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). Phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium fertilizers components represent more than 200 million tonnes of production annually. Given that most of the fertilizer production process is dependent on fossil fuels as fuel and feedstock, the amount of CO2 generated is at least 3 tonnes CO2 per tonne of fertilizer. The introduction, in the future, of less intensive carbon technological components and lower energy-consuming separation and catalytic technologies in the fertilizers industry has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions drastically. In this review, we thoroughly analyze the GHG emissions of the fertilizers industry over time and explore pathways to achieve viable and sustainable decarbonization solutions. In the review, we also aim to explore, whenever information is available, the factors (sources) and the ranges of GHG emissions in the different value chains of fertilizer plants. As a result, an overview of the literature on GHG emissions from synthetic fertilizers (N, P, K) industries will be given. More emphasis is on emissions that stem from the extraction of raw materials to final fertilizer products (energy source, efficiency, and fertilizer type) and transportation of intermediates within different sites of the plants (vehicle type, fuel type, and efficiency). A perspective analysis on possible recommendations for future net-zero carbon emissions and carbon capture technologies is also made.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to investigate the techno-economic feasibility of supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of black liquor integrated to a Kraft pulp mill. The process simulations have been performed through Aspen Plus software. The assessment includes five integration scenarios: stainless steel 316 or Inconel 625 as the reactor materials and hydrogen or combined heat and power (CHP) as the target products. The results illustrates that Inconel reactor is more profitable for CHP production than stainless steel as well as providing lower production cost of hydrogen. Inconel is also more robust against loss of pulping chemicals and changes in the energy price. However, the assessment uses the experimental yields even though surface-to-volume ratio of the reactor will reduce in the industrial scale. Therefore, the results should be validated in pilot scale as well before implementation. Nevertheless, a special reactor configuration can increase surface area. The techno-economic results can be improved by comprehensive investigations of process conditions including also residence time, the concentration of reactor inlet and heterogeneous catalyst. In addition, the SCWG process integrated to a pulp mill can also receive feedstocks from other biomass sectors. This would improve the economic and environmental performances of those sectors as well.},

  abstract = {The aim of the current paper is to discuss the sustainability aspect of biorefinery systems with focus on biomass supply chains, processing of biomass feedstocks in biorefinery platforms and sustainability assessment methodologies. From the stand point of sustainability, it is important to optimize the agricultural production system and minimize the related environmental impacts at the farming system level. These impacts are primarily related to agri-chemical inputs and the related undesired environmental emissions and to the repercussions from biomass production. At the same time, the biorefineries need a year-round supply of biomass and about 40--60\% of the total operating cost of a typical biorefinery is related to the feedstocks chosen, and thus highlights on the careful prioritization of feedstocks mainly based on their economic and environmental loadings. Regarding the processing in biorefinery platforms, chemical composition of biomasses is important. Biomasses with higher concentrations of cellulose and hemicelluloses compared to lignin are preferred for bioethanol production in the lignocellulosic biorefinery, since the biodegradability of cellulose is higher than lignin. A green biorefinery platform enables the extraction of protein from grasses, producing an important alternative to importing protein sources for food products and animal feed, while also allowing processing of residues to deliver bioethanol. Currently, there are several approaches to integrate biorefinery platforms, which are aimed to enhance their economic and environmental sustainability. Regarding sustainability assessment, the complexities related to the material flows in a biorefinery and the delivery of alternative biobased products means dealing with multiple indicators in the decision-making process to enable comparisons of alternatives. Life Cycle Assessment is regarded as one of the most relevant tools to assess the environmental hotspots in the biomass supply chains, at processing stages and also to support in the prioritization of any specific biobased products and the alternatives delivered from biorefineries.},

  abstract = {Chemical conversions have been a cornerstone of industrial revolution and societal progress. Continuing this progress in a resource constrained world poses a critical challenge which demands the development of innovative chemical processes to meet our energy and material needs in a sustainable way. This challenge forms the basis for this article. We report a method for quick preliminary assessment of chemical processes at the laboratory stage. The proposed method enables a review of chemical processes within a broader sustainability context. It is inspired by green chemistry principles, techno-economic analysis and some elements of environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA). This method evaluates a proposed chemical process against comparable existing processes using a multi-criteria approach that integrates various economic and environmental indicators. An effort has been made to incorporate quantitative and qualitative information about the processes while making the method transparent and easy to implement based on information available at an early stage in process development. The idea is to provide a data-based assessment tool for chemists and engineers to develop sustainable chemistry. This paper describes the method in detail and examines plausibility of the results. A biobased process for the production of but-1,3-diene has been analyzed using this method. This biobased process is compared with a conventional process for the production of but-1,3-diene from petroleum sources. The effects of uncertainty in the underlying model parameters and assumptions are also analyzed, along with the effect of system boundary selection on the assessment outcome. Analysis and testing of the method shows that it can be used as a valuable tool for sustainable process development.},

Downdraft gasifiers are typically small-scale units having maximum power production capacity up to 5MW. This feature makes it more suitable for decentralized power generation and distribution to the remote villages/islands deprived of grid electricity. Mathematical models can be helpful for the design of gasifiers, prediction of operational behavior, emissions during normal conditions, startup, shutdown, change of fuel, change of loading, and to alleviate the type of problems mentioned above. It has been observed that although many researchers have developed models of various types and degrees of complexity, reviews of these modeling and simulation studies are scarce. Largely, it is observed that the review articles reported in the literature fail to address the basic understanding of each model types and their applicability to design different gasifiers for a certain feedstock and variation of operating parameters. This review article discusses different models available for downdraft gasifiers such as thermodynamic equilibrium, kinetic, CFD, ANN and ASPEN Plus models. A comparative analysis of each model and its output is carried out. A critical analysis of the effect of different modeling parameters and finally the advantages and disadvantages of each modeling technique is outlined.},

This paper presents a simplified model for the gasification process based on chemical equilibrium considerations. The model consists in the minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the produced gas, constrained by mass and energy balances for the system. Despite the simplicity of the model, its results are reliable in identifying the tendencies of the working parameters of the system. A parametric study has been carried aiming the verification of the influence of many variables inherent to the model, such as: gasification temperature, moisture content, and air temperature, among others. The results were compared with those found in literature and real systems. Following this parametric study, an exergy analysis has been performed in order to evaluate irreversibilities associated to the process, and the influence of temperature, moisture, charcoal production, and thermal losses on them. Finally, a first attempt to integrate a gasifier into a sugarcane mill was performed, which showed the potential benefits regarding the use of such technology.},

Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is attracting attention due to the wide variety of applications and the possibility of producing it from carbon dioxide. In this work, the DMC production process via urea has been optimized. Two main sections can be distinguished: the synthesis of urea and the production of DMC. An equation based approach is used to model the system. The DMC production from renewable ammonia/methanol/CO2 presents a promising production cost, around 520 {\texteuro}/t. The production of urea alone has also been evaluated in this work. A sensitivity analysis is carried out showing the influence of the methanol price in the DMC cost and the ammonia price in the urea cost. A simplified sustainability index is used to evaluate the environmental performance of urea/DMC production.},

  abstract = {Energy consumption linked to non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and increases resource depletion. In this context, the use of agricultural solid residues such as rice husk, coffee husk, wheat straw, sugar cane bagasse, among others, has been widely studied as an alternative energy source in order to decrease the use of fossil fuels. In Peru, up to 693,308 metric tons of rice husk is generated annually and at present, 85\% is burned in the open air or disposed in rivers, harming human health and contaminating our environment. On the other hand, official Peruvian energy policy is to incorporate the use of renewable energy sources, such as agricultural residues. Consequently, the aim of the study is to perform a technical and environmental assessment of the production of energy from rice husk as an alternative energy source to coal in Peru. Rice husk from Peru was characterized to identify its physical properties and chemical composition. In order to perform the environmental assessment, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was employed. LCA is a standardized methodology to identify and quantify the environmental impacts from initial obtention of materials, through production, distribution and use to final disposal (ISO 14040, 2006 and ISO 14044, 2006). Four scenarios were evaluated, varying in paddy rice yield and dryer efficiency. The results show that the environmental impacts to obtain 1\,MJ from rice husk, including elements in the global warming, acidification and eutrophication categories, are less than that from 1\,MJ obtained from coal, 97\%, 88\% and 80\% less, respectively. However, the opposite was found in water depletion, with the use of coal to generate heat having a 98\% better impact over rice husk.},

Perturbations of genes on the lignin biosynthetic pathway may result in striking compositional and structural changes that in turn suggest novel approaches for altering lignin and even `designing' the polymer to enhance its value or with a view toward its simpler removal from the cell wall polysaccharides. Basic structural studies on various native lignins increasingly refine our knowledge of lignin structure, and examining lignins in different species reveals the extent to which evolution and natural variation have resulted in the incorporation of `non-traditional' phenolic monomers, including phenolics from beyond the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. As a result, the very definition of lignin continues to be expanded and refined.},

The model can be used as a predictive tool for optimization of the gasifier performance.The Gasifier has been modeled in three stages. In first stage moisture content of biomass feed is reduced. In second stage biomass is decomposed into its elements by specifying yield distribution. In third stage gasification reactions have been modeled using Gibbs free energy minimization approach. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results obtained through hybrid biomass gasifier. In the simulation study, the operating parameters like Temperature, Equivalence Ratio (ER), Biomass Moisture Content and Steam Injection have been varied over wide range and the effect of these parameters on syngas composition, High Heating Value (HHV) and Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE) has been investigated. Temperature increases the production of CO and H2. Increasing ER decreases the production of CO and H2 which decreases the CGE. Biomass moisture content is an important parameter affecting the heating value of the gas. Steam injection favors hydrogen production. The performance of the simulated gasifier has been compared using experimental data for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Food Waste (FW) and Poultry Waste~(PW).},

However, a significant drawback of the machine learning approaches is their poor physical interpretability when relying on limited experimental data. In the present work, a physics-informed neural network method (PINN) is developed to predict biomass gasification products (N2, H2, CO, CO2, and CH4). PINN simultaneously considers regression, structure, and physical monotonicity constraints in the loss function, providing physically feasible predictions. Specifically, the PINN models have outperformed prediction capability (average test R2 0.91--0.97) compared to five other machine learning methods through 50 times random sample classifications. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the developed models can maintain correct monotonicity even if the feedstock characteristics or gasification conditions are outside the training data. By using a reliable physical mechanism to guide machine learning, the model can ensure better generalizability and scientific interpretability.},

In the integrated chemical plants proposed in this work, the purpose is co-producing pulp and gaseous fuels, either hydrogen or synthetic natural gas, in order to expand the biorefinery product portfolio and, consequently, increase the plant revenues. However, due to additional equipment and utility demands, along with the uncertainty about the prices of the commodities; the benefits of the integrated setups must be thoroughly weighed by considering thermodynamic, economic and environmental indicators before the retrofit of the existing configuration is implemented. The exergy method is used along with the energy integration technique and other financial indicators to determine whether and in which scenarios the integrated biorefineries would be more attractive. The average exergy efficiency of the integrated chemical production plants is 44\%, which is higher than that of the conventional case (40\%). The balance of the overall CO2 emissions vary from 1.97 to -0.56 tCO2/tPulp, for the conventional and integrated setups, respectively. An incremental financial analysis under uncertainty also shows that the hydrogen production route with partial import of electricity and carbon taxations above 60 EUR/tCO2 outperforms the other scenarios. Therefore, the import of electricity from low-carbon grids and the upgrade of biorefinery residues arise as key factors for ensuring the sustainable production of traditionally fossil-based chemicals under more stringent environmental regulations.},

The design problem addressed in this paper requires specifying the optimal operating conditions (inlet and outlet temperature of the lean solution stream on the absorber, CO2 loading, amine composition and flow rates, among others) to achieve the given CO2 emission targets at a minimum total annual cost. A detailed objective function including total operating costs and investment is considered. The influence of the variation of CO2 reduction targets and the mixing proportion of amines on the total annual cost is analyzed in detail. Numerical results are presented and discussed using different case studies. The results demonstrate that process simulators can be used as a powerful tool not only to simulate but also to optimize the most important design parameters of the post-combustion CO2 capture process.},

The work presents arguments for why these issues impact solution cost and time more than does scalable performance. The final chapter explores the question of scalable execution and shows how scalable design relates to scalable execution. The book's focus is on program organization, which has received considerable attention in the broader software engineering community, where graphical description standards for modeling software structure and behavior have been developed by computer scientists. These discussions might be enriched by engineers who write scientific codes. This book aims to bring such scientific programmers into discussion with computer scientists. The authors do so by introducing object-oriented software design patterns in the context of scientific simulation.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a methodological framework for assessing the sustainability of solid biofuels in Mexico. The designed framework comprises 13 normalized indicators and two diagnostic studies, covering the economic, social, environmental, and institutional sustainability dimensions, and their intersections. Indicators are normalized using the concept of load capacity of a system, similarly to the planetary boundaries. Thus, the graphical representation of results facilitates their multidimensional analysis. The framework was applied to three case studies: traditional fuelwood in rural households, charcoal for restaurant grilling, and electricity cogeneration from sugarcane bagasse. This was part of an iterative process of testing and refining the framework and simultaneously demonstrating its application in the Mexican bioenergy context. This led to the conclusion that the resulting framework (a) provides a useful, quantitative, and comprehensive overview of both broad and specific sustainability aspects of the assessed system; (b) requires a balance of accessible but also scattered or sensitive data, similarly to most existing frameworks; (c) is highly flexible and applicable to both modern and traditional solid biofuels; and (d) is simple to communicate and interpret for a wide audience. Key directions for improvement of the framework are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Biomass has proven to be an effective energy carrier capable of fulfilling the growing demand of clean and everlasting energy source for the sustainable development of society. Among different biomass conversion routes, biomass gasification is one of the most promising thermochemical routes for conversion of biomass into gaseous fuel for both heat and power generation applications besides biofuel production through fermentation. But, we are unable to present these gaseous fuels directly for domestic and commercial uses, which indicates the existence of various barriers including the lack of research in this area. In this article, various barriers to the technology, such as challenges with biomass supply chain management, biomass pretreatment, generic shortcomings, gas conditioning and conversion technology have been highlighted. Based on recent studies, the gasification of biomass, gas conditioning, government policies and utilization of fuel gas for heat and power generation applications have been identified as the greatest challenges. Despite the availability of different gasifier reactors, a highly efficient reactor design is yet to be developed for successful operation and commercialization. Thus, an advanced gasification system with efficient gas conditioning technology can significantly overcome many of the barriers.},

This type of gasifier obtains high-energy release rates due to the lower inlet air velocity and extended reaction zone. The numerical model couples the performance of the individual particles and the external gas phase reactions to describe the gasifier performance. By calculating the performance of individual particles, the computational model is able to determine the interaction between the combustion of charcoal particles in the lower portion of the bed and the pyrolysis of wood sticks in the upper region. Most importantly, the model can describe the effect on overall system performance when conditions within the gasifier are changed, such as changes in the wood or char particle size, moisture content, gasifier height, inlet velocity, etc. The results of the model are compared with the gasifier performance for a gasifier using sticks with a 6cm diameter, a length of 68cm and a dry density of 600kgm-3. The model results are used to investigate the performance of the gasifier under a variety of load conditions, fuel sizes, and moisture conditions.},

To operate biorefineries of any kind, however, the availability of biomass inputs is crucial and must be considered during planning. Here, we develop a planning approach that uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to account for spatially scattered biomass when optimizing a biorefinery's location, capacity, and configuration. To deal with the challenges of a non-smooth objective function arising from the geographic data, higher dimensionality, and strict constraints, the planning problem is repeatedly decomposed by nesting an exact nonlinear program (NLP) inside an evolutionary strategy (ES) heuristic, which handles the spatial data from the GIS. We demonstrate the functionality of the algorithm and show how including spatial data improves the planning process by optimizing a synthesis gas biorefinery using this new planning approach.},

Due to the importance of the cane industry and its contribution to a wide range of biobased energy and other products, LCA studies regarding cane-derived products are needed to assess their environmental benefits. The main objective of this work was the assessment of life cycle energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to cane sugar and ethanol, considering bagasse and electricity surpluses as coproducts. We performed an overall balance for the Brazilian Center-South Region, adopting different methods to evaluate sugar and ethanol production separately. The GREET 1.8c.0 model was used for the `well-to-wheels' calculations but adapted to the comprehensive set of Brazilian parameters that best represent the Center-South Region. For the reference case, fossil energy use and GHG emissions related to sugar production were evaluated as 721 kJ/kg and 234 g CO               2               eq/kg, respectively. For the ethanol life cycle, these values were 80 kJ/MJ and 21.3 g CO               2               eq/MJ. Special attention was paid to the variation of some parameters among producing units based on data collected by industry. The consequent uncertainties in ethanol life cycle emissions were assessed through a Monte Carlo analysis based on assigned distribution of probability curves for eleven selected parameters and informed by partial statistical data available from industry for distribution generation. Projections were also made for 2020 scenario parameters based on the best in current class technologies and technological improvements deemed commercially possible today.

  abstract = {The EU is one of the largest producers and consumers of wood pellets in the world, covering around 36\% of the global wood pellet production and around 50\% of the global consumption in 2018. The EU wood pellet consumption is expected to further increase in response to the ambitious energy and climate goals for 2030. Currently, wood pellets are mainly produced from sawdust and other sawmill residues; however, other types of forest feedstock are being investigated in order to meet the increasing wood pellet demand and move toward greater energy independence. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the environmental impact of different wood pellet supply chains. A comparative cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment is performed considering the following wood feedstock systems: (i) sawdust from sawmill (S1), (ii) roundwood logs (S2), (iii) whole trees from forest thinning operation (S3), and (iv) logging residues produced during forest tree harvesting (S4). The study focuses on Global Warming Potential (GWP), Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP), and Human Toxicity Potential (HTP). Results show that S3 displays the lowest figures on all the environmental impact categories considered in this study. Compared to the reference case S1, S3 shows a GWP reduction of 46\%, an ODP reduction of 6.6\%, a POCP reduction of 14.8\%, and HTP reduction of 13.2\%. S3 and S4 have lower GWP than S1 and S2, even when the biogenic CO2 emissions are considered. Overall, the life cycle phases that have the highest GWP, POCP, and HTP are the burning phase and the preparation of the material to be pelletized, particularly the drying process. Nevertheless, the main phases that contribute to the ODP are the forest operations and the pellet preparation.},

Biofuels are recognised as one of the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels, as they can be produced from various types of feedstock. The efficiency and sustainability of biomass-based production can be maximised by producing biofuels along with other valuable coproducts in a ``biorefinery''. This concept was proposed to make the production of biofuels and biochemicals more economically viable by taking advantage of opportunities for process integration and waste recovery. In this work, a novel hybrid optimisation model that combines superstructure-based optimisation approach and insight-based automated targeting for the synthesis of a sustainable integrated biorefinery is presented. In addition, fuzzy optimisation is also adapted to synthesize such integrated facility with the simultaneous consideration of both economic and environmental performance. Note that the proposed approach is a generic synthesis strategy that can be applied even without detailed modelling of individual processes.},

  abstract = {When the objective is to generate motive or electric power via I.C. engine, the overall pressure drop through the suction gasification system in addition to gas quality has become a sensitive issue. This work, therefore, presents an experimental study on a suction gasifier (downdraft) arrangement operating on kiker wood or Acacia nilotica (L). Studies were conducted to investigate the influence of fluid flow rate on pressure drop through the gasifier system for ambient isothermal airflow and ignited mode, pumping power, and air-fuel ratio, gas composition and gasification efficiency. Results of pressure drop, temperature profile, gas composition or calorific value are found to be sensitive with fluid flow rate.

  abstract = {When the objective is to generate motive or electric power via I.C. engine, the overall pressure drop through the suction gasification system in addition to gas quality has become a sensitive issue. This work, therefore, presents an experimental study on a suction gasifier (downdraft) arrangement operating on kiker wood or Acacia nilotica (L). Studies were conducted to investigate the influence of fluid flow rate on pressure drop through the gasifier system for ambient isothermal airflow and ignited mode, pumping power, and air-fuel ratio, gas composition and gasification efficiency. Results of pressure drop, temperature profile, gas composition or calorific value are found to be sensitive with fluid flow rate. Ignited gasifier gives much higher pressure drop when compared against newly charged gasifier bed with isothermal ambient airflow. Higher reaction temperatures in gasifier tends to enhance gasifier performance, while, overall pressure drop and thus pumping power through the system increases.

Commercially available physical solvents are presented, followed by an assessment of the ideal properties that are important for development of novel solvents for CO2 capture from high-pressure syngas streams. To compare the technical and economic perfor\- mance of traditional and novel physical solvents, a review of the methods, assumptions and models used in techno-economic analysis (TEA) studies was conducted. It was found that, although some novel solvents show promising technical performance in the laboratory (e.g., high CO2 absorption capacity and low vapor pressure), other issues (e.g., solvent viscosity and cost) may limit their industrial applications. Process simulations were useful tools for modeling the technical performance of processes using traditional and novel solvents. However, model predictions are most reliable when the methods and correlations used to develop the process simulation are validated with representative experimental data, in particular highly accurate baseline models are required for fair comparison among physical solvents. The key inputs and assumptions in pre-combustion CO2 capture TEAs have also been summarized. Some studies showed that the promising technical performance of novel physical solvents can be offset by the high and often unknown costs of these solvents. Future development of novel physical solvents for pre-combustion CO2 capture will benefit from more studies that conduct in-depth techno-economic analysis, specifically with validated process simulations and transparent economic models.},

  abstract = {Bioeconomy, as a key strategic innovation pillar, supports energy transition and involves biomass resource assessment and its application. Biomass has an enormous potential to fulfil the domestic energy demand in Brazil. Hence, this study aims to quantify the theoretical, technical and techno-economic potential of agricultural and forestry residues to generate electricity via thermochemical processes in Brazil for the 2018--2050 timeframe. The analysis was carried out via an integrated approach, according to statistical reports and literature data. Conversion technologies for the estimation of technical potential consist of organic rankine cycle, combustion with conventional rankine cycle and gasification with an internal combustion engine. The results showed that Brazil's theoretical potential is 7185.39 PJ and 16,708.12 PJ in 2018 and 2050. The technical potential in 2018 is 1795.16 PJ, generating 71,236.47 MWe, while the potential in 2050 is projected as 5771.49.4 PJ providing 229,027.31 MWe. The main restrictions are dispersed distribution of biomass over a large area, supply costs, and low efficiencies for energy conversion. Therefore, the techno-economic potential is around 19,704.01 MWe and 63,348.95 MWe for 2018 and 2050. The north region has the lowest electricity generation potential, while the southeast region takes a prominent position to generate electricity mainly from sugarcane residues. Levelized costs of electricity values varied from 10.532 to 15.507 US\$/MWh for 2018 and from 7.320 to 13.002 US\$/MWh for 2050, which highly influenced by the biomass price. The results of this study can support policy-making towards future planning on Brazilian bioenergy.},

  abstract = {The term Process Systems Engineering (PSE) is relatively recent. It was coined about 50 years ago at the outset of the modern era of computer-aided engineering. However, the engineering of processing systems is almost as old as the beginning of the chemical industry, around the first half of the 19th century. Initially, the practice of PSE was qualitative and informal, but as time went on it was formalized in progressively increasing degrees. Today, it is solidly founded on engineering sciences and an array of systems-theoretical methodologies and computer-aided tools. This paper is not a review of the theoretical and methodological contributions by various researchers in the area of PSE. Its primary objective is to provide an overview of the history of PSE, i.e. its origin and evolution; a brief illustration of its tremendous impact in the development of modern chemical industry; its state at the turn of the 21st century; and an outline of the role it can play in addressing the societal problems that we face today such as; securing sustainable production of energy, chemicals and materials for the human wellbeing, alternative energy sources, and improving the quality of life and of our living environment. PSE has expanded significantly beyond its original scope, the continuous and batch chemical processes and their associated process engineering problems. Today, PSE activities encompass the creative design, operation, and control of: biological systems (prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells); complex networks of chemical reactions; free or guided self-assembly processes; micro- and nano-scale processes; and systems that integrate engineered processes with processes driven by humans, legal and regulatory institutions. Through its emphasis on synthesis problems, PSE provides the dialectic complement to the analytical bent of chemical engineering science, thus establishing the healthy tension between synthesis and analysis, the foundation of any thriving discipline. As a consequence, throughout this paper PSE emerges as the foundational underpinning of modern chemical engineering; the one that ensures the discipline's cohesiveness in the years to come.},

The effect of the co-catalyst (CaCl2 + ash) on glycolaldehyde concentration (\%) was examined. Thermogravimetric-Fourier-transform infrared (TG-FTIR) analysis was applied to optimize the pyrolysis temperature and biomass-to-catalyst ratio for glycolaldehyde-rich bio-oil production. By TG-FTIR analysis, the highest glycolaldehyde concentration of 8.57\% was obtained at 500 {$^\circ$}C without the catalyst, while 12.76 and 13.56\% were obtained with the catalyst at 500 {$^\circ$}C for a 1:6 ratio of SS-to-CaCl2 and a 1:4 ratio of SS-to-ash, respectively. Meanwhile, the highest glycolaldehyde concentrations (\%) determined by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (GC--MS) analysis for bio-oils produced at 500 {$^\circ$}C (without the catalyst), a 1:6 ratio of SS-to-CaCl2, and a 1:4 ratio of SS-to-ash were found to be 11.3, 17.1, and 16.8\%, respectively. These outcomes were fully consistent with the TG-FTIR results. Moreover, the effect of temperature on product distribution was investigated, and the highest bio-oil yield was achieved at 500 {$^\circ$}C as 56.1\%. This research work aims to develop an environment-friendly extraction technique involving aqueous-based imitation for glycolaldehyde extraction with 23.6\% yield. Meanwhile, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) analysis was used to confirm the purity of the extracted glycolaldehyde, which was found as 91\%.},

  abstract = {This work evaluates the potential to produce synthetic nitrogen fertilizers by using sugarcane bagasse gasification in the S{\~a}o Paulo state, Brazil, aiming to increase the economic revenues and to decarbonize a chemical sector traditionally based on natural gas. The partial or total substitution of natural gas by consuming bagasse and enabling an intensive import of electricity from the Brazilian electricity mix is studied. The comparative assessment of the alternative production routes considers a reference case in which the residual bagasse is used only to generate surplus power at the cogeneration unit of the sugarcane mill, whereas ammonia is typically produced by consuming only natural gas. Unlike the conventional scenario, the proposed alternative routes employ surplus bagasse to produce ammonia. Regarding the unit exergy cost of ammonia, an increase between 50\% and 100\% is expected for the biomass-based routes (2.4498--3.1780~kJ/kJNH3) when compared to the conventional case (1.5866~kJ/kJNH3). In contrast, the net CO2 emissions balance of the alternative scenario achieve negative values (-2.5017 tCO2/tNH3), in comparison to the net CO2 positive emissions (1.75 tCO2/tNH3) of the conventional scenario. Additionally, the best location of the ammonia plant is nearby a sugarcane mill with a milling capacity of 10~Mt/y and 20~km far from another smaller sugarcane mill, in order to achieve an ammonia production potential of 1,200 tNH3/day. Concerning the economic analysis, if no carbon taxes are considered, the net present value (NPV) of the alternative scenarios drops up to 52\%, compared to the conventional scenario. Finally, since 1.6 MtCO2/y can be avoided by using the residual bagasse as feedstock in the ammonia plant, the alternative scenarios become competitive vis-{\`a}-vis the conventional scenario in terms of NPV when carbon taxes of 40--50 USD/tCO2 are adopted. In the absence of carbon taxes, the drawback of the seasonality of the sugarcane crops (240~days of operation compared to 340~days for the conventional scenario) contributes to the decrease (39\%--51\%) of the NPV for the alternative scenarios.},

In a disarmingly simple, step-by-step style that never sacrifices mathematical rigor, the authors --- Morris Tenenbaum of Cornell University, and Harry Pollard of Purdue University --- introduce and explain complex, critically-important concepts to undergraduate students of mathematics, engineering and the sciences.The book begins with a section that examines the origin of differential equations, defines basic terms and outlines the general solution of a differential equation-the solution that actually contains every solution of such an equation. Subsequent sections deal with such subjects as: integrating factors; dilution and accretion problems; the algebra of complex numbers; the linearization of first order systems; Laplace Transforms; Newton's Interpolation Formulas; and Picard's Method of Successive Approximations.The book contains two exceptional chapters: one on series methods of solving differential equations, the second on numerical methods of solving differential equations. The first includes a discussion of the Legendre Differential Equation, Legendre Functions, Legendre Polynomials, the Bessel Differential Equation, and the Laguerre Differential Equation. Throughout the book, every term is clearly defined and every theorem lucidly and thoroughly analyzed, and there is an admirable balance between the theory of differential equations and their application. An abundance of solved problems and practice exercises enhances the value of Ordinary Differential Equations as a classroom text for undergraduate students and teaching professionals. The book concludes with an in-depth examination of existence and uniqueness theorems about a variety of differential equations, as well as an introduction to the theory of determinants and theorems about Wronskians.},

The present work proposes an optimization framework for biorefineries design that considers these dynamics. Four interconnected decision layers were considered: biomass supply, conversion processes, storage, and markets. The model is formulated as a MILP for maximizing the operational Net Present Value. An illustrative case-study was presented for lignin extraction in eucalyptus Kraft Pulp mills in Brazil. Land availability, forest productivity, and interest rates were fundamental for the location and sizing of production facilities. Logistics networks prioritized the minimization of sales taxes over transportation distance. The precipitation technology has become financially attractive in a scenario with a 50\% lignin price increase. The optimal technology location was Sao Paulo due to lower opportunities costs and markets' vicinity.

The model is based on the mass and energy conservation equations and includes the energy exchange between solid and gaseous phases, and the heat transfer by radiation from the solid particles. Different gasification sub-processes are incorporated: biomass drying, pyrolysis, oxidation of char and volatile matter, chemical reduction of H2, CO2 and H2O by char, and hydrocarbon reforming. The model was validated experimentally in a small-scale gasifier by comparing the experimental temperature fields, biomass burning rates and fuel/air equivalence ratios with predicted results. A good agreement between experimental and estimated results was achieved. The model can be used as a tool to study the influence of process parameters, such as biomass particle mean diameter, air flow velocity, gasifier geometry, composition and inlet temperature of the gasifying agent and biomass type, on the process propagation velocity (flame front velocity) and its efficiency. The maximum efficiency was obtained with the smaller particle size and lower air velocity. It was a consequence of the higher fuel/air ratio in the gasifier and so the production of a gas with a higher calorific value.},

  abstract = {Commitments made to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and the need to develop low carbon sources of power and heat, are likely to lead to the continued or even increased use of biomass as an energy source. Biomass is already replacing coal within large scale electricity generation systems. At smaller scales it is utilized within combined heat and power systems, as well domestically for the provision of heat. Unabated, biomass combustion leads to a range of pollutant emissions, including CO, CO2, methane, and black and organic carbon, which are of relevance from a climate perspective, as well as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, dioxins, furans and precursors of ozone, and secondary organic aerosols, which impact on air quality (AQ) and human health. Epidemiological data suggests that biomass smoke contributes to at least 40\,000 premature deaths per year in Europe, as well as negatively affecting respiratory and cardiovascular health. Hence, if biomass is to be used as a future energy source, its AQ impacts need to be addressed. Here, a short review is provided of the potential climate and AQ impacts of the direct use of solid biomass as a fuel for the provision of power and heat. This review provides a brief summary of the chemical and physical characteristics of emissions from biomass utilization for energy provision. The impacts of biomass burning on ambient AQ and health (in particular for fine particulates) are addressed in both outdoor and indoor environments and for industrialized and developing countries. Issues of appliance scale, and how these influence available mitigation options, emissions factors, and regulatory limits for biomass combustors, are discussed. Final perspectives are offered, from the point of view of the need to develop ``win--win'' strategies for the future utilization of biomass which minimize both climate and air quality impacts.},

On the other hand, when the least-squares function is very flat, the algorithm may easily become lost in parameter space. We introduce several improvements to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in order to improve both its convergence speed and robustness to initial parameter guesses. We update the usual step to include a geodesic acceleration correction term, explore a systematic way of accepting uphill steps that may increase the residual sum of squares due to Umrigar and Nightingale, and employ the Broyden method to update the Jacobian matrix. We test these changes by comparing their performance on a number of test problems with standard implementations of the algorithm. We suggest that these two particular challenges, slow convergence and robustness to initial guesses, are complimentary problems. Schemes that improve convergence speed often make the algorithm less robust to the initial guess, and vice versa. We provide an open source implementation of our improvements that allow the user to adjust the algorithm parameters to suit particular needs.},

  abstract = {This biomass gasification process study compares the energetic and economic efficiencies of a dual fluidised bed and an oxygen-blown entrained flow gasifier from 10MWth to 500MWth. While fluidised bed gasification became the most applied technology for biomass in small and medium scale facilities, entrained flow gasification technology is still used exclusively for industrial scale coal gasification. Therefore, it is analysed whether and for which capacity the entrained flow technology is an energetically and economically efficient option for the thermo-chemical conversion of biomass. Special attention is given to the pre-conditioning methods for biomass to enable the application in an entrained flow gasifier. Process chains are selected for the two gasifier types and subsequently transformed to simulation models. The simulation results show that the performance of both gasifier types is similar for the production of a pressurised product gas (2.5MPa). The cold gas efficiency of the fluidised bed is 76--79\% and about 0.5--2 percentage points higher than for the entrained flow reactor. The net efficiencies of both technologies are similar and between 64\% and 71\% depending on scale. The auxiliary power consumption of the entrained flow reactor is caused mainly by the air separation unit, the oxygen compression, and the fuel pulverisation, whereas the fluidised bed requires additional power mainly for gas compression. The costs for the product gas are determined as between {\texteuro}4.2cent/kWh (500MWth) and {\texteuro}7.4cent/kWh (10MWth) in the economic analysis of both technologies. The study indicates that the entrained flow reactor is competitive technology for biomass gasification also on a smaller scale.},

Like other chemical processes, they can benefit from computer-aided optimization at the design stage, but systematic optimization procedures are rarely employed due to the challenges of simulating the requisite rate-based mass transfer and reaction models. This paper presents a novel approach for the simulation and optimization of rate-based columns, with specific application to the absorber and stripper columns found in (amine-) solvent-based carbon capture processes. The approach is based on pseudo-transient continuation, and the resulting column models are easily incorporated into large-scale process flowsheets with other previously developed pseudo-transient models. We demonstrate that the proposed approach allows for gradient-based optimization of next-generation amine scrubbing processes by considering a complex carbon capture process under three different operating conditions. The results provide general insight into the design of amine scrubbing processes, and shadow prices at the optimal point(s) suggest potential avenues for improving the process economics. The effects of carbon dioxide removal percentage and flue gas composition on process economics are briefly analyzed.},

Nitrogen fertilizers are a necessity to maintain the high agricultural production that the world's population currently demands. Ammonia produced from nonfossil-based feedstocks would enable renewable production of ammonia. Renewable feedstocks are one thing, but perhaps even more important in the future are the security of supply that decentralized production enables. In this study, the techno-economic evaluation of production of ammonia from various renewable feedstocks and for several plant sizes was investigated. The feedstocks included in this study are grid-based electricity produced from wind power, biogas, and woody biomass. The feedstocks differed in exergy, and to make a fair comparison, the electric equivalence ratios method was used. The results showed that the energy consumption for biogas and electricity is the same at 42 GJ/tonne ammonia. When using the electric equivalence comparison for the same cases, the results are 26 and 42 GJ/tonne, respectively. Biomass-based production has an energy consumption of 58 GJ/tonne and 31 GJ/tonne when using the electric equivalence comparison, which should be compared with the industrial average of 37 GJ (or 21 GJ electric equivalence) per tonne of ammonia. Monte Carlo simulations were used to vary the inputs to the process to evaluate the production cost. The ammonia production cost ranged from \$680 to 2300/tonne ammonia for the various cases studied. {\copyright} 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 33: 1290--1297, 2014},

  abstract = {Ammonia, a molecule that is gaining more interest as a fueling vector, has been considered as a candidate to power transport, produce energy, and support heating applications for decades. However, the particular characteristics of the molecule always made it a chemical with low, if any, benefit once compared to conventional fossil fuels. Still, the current need to decarbonize our economy makes the search of new methods crucial to use chemicals, such as ammonia, that can be produced and employed without incurring in the emission of carbon oxides. Therefore, current efforts in this field are leading scientists, industries, and governments to seriously invest efforts in the development of holistic solutions capable of making ammonia a viable fuel for the transition toward a clean future. On that basis, this review has approached the subject gathering inputs from scientists actively working on the topic. The review starts from the importance of ammonia as an energy vector, moving through all of the steps in the production, distribution, utilization, safety, legal considerations, and economic aspects of the use of such a molecule to support the future energy mix. Fundamentals of combustion and practical cases for the recovery of energy of ammonia are also addressed, thus providing a complete view of what potentially could become a vector of crucial importance to the mitigation of carbon emissions. Different from other works, this review seeks to provide a holistic perspective of ammonia as a chemical that presents benefits and constraints for storing energy from sustainable sources. State-of-the-art knowledge provided by academics actively engaged with the topic at various fronts also enables a clear vision of the progress in each of the branches of ammonia as an energy carrier. Further, the fundamental boundaries of the use of the molecule are expanded to real technical issues for all potential technologies capable of using it for energy purposes, legal barriers that will be faced to achieve its deployment, safety and environmental considerations that impose a critical aspect for acceptance and wellbeing, and economic implications for the use of ammonia across all aspects approached for the production and implementation of this chemical as a fueling source. Herein, this work sets the principles, research, practicalities, and future views of a transition toward a future where ammonia will be a major energy player.},

Theoretical and practical consequences of the "negative flash" are discussed. For example, it is shown that the negative flash corresponds to a saddle point in the Gibbs energy surface. It is also shown that the limits of pressure and temperature where the negative flash ceases to converge to a non-trivial solution defines the well-known convergence pressure envelope of the mixture. Finally, it is suggested that the continuity of properties across phase boundaries, as calculated by the negative flash, makes the method attractive for algorithms that nest a standard P-T flash inside an outer loop (e.g., an isenthalpic flash or a three-phase dewpoint).},

  abstract = {Gasification technology can effectively improve the utilization efficiency of coal and biomass resources. However, conventional experimental methods are costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive to optimize the system performance of the different coal or biomass gasification process. Therefore, this study developed a hybrid data-driven machine learning framework for predicting the performance of coal and biomass gasification processes. To select the best machine learning model for the gasification process, the artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, multiple linear regression, and support vector machine models are established with the hybrid database and assessed by seven regression evaluation indicators. The results indicate ANN model has the best prediction performance because it has the highest coefficient of determination (0.9242). To improve the prediction accuracy of the ANN model, the number of its hidden layers and neurons is first investigated and optimized. The results indicate that the preferred network structure of the ANN model is a double hidden layer neural network with 24 neurons. A genetic algorithm is then employed to improve the prediction performance of the optimized ANN model, which can further reduce the error of the ANN model. Finally, the genetic algorithm-optimized ANN model is applied to analyze the actual coal and biomass gasification processes. Results show that anthracite coal mixed with pine sawdust has the most significant impact on the gas yield of the gasification process, and bituminous coal mixed with rice husk has the most significant impact on the lower heating value of gasification process. Although the model has good predictive performance, it can continue to be improved by considering different equivalence or gasification ratios.},

Unlike line search type methods where a line search is carried out in each iteration, trust region methods compute a trial step by solving a trust region subproblem where a model function is minimized within a trust region. Due to the trust region constraint, nonconvex models can be used in trust region subproblems, and trust region algorithms can be applied to nonconvex and ill-conditioned problems. Normally it is easier to establish the global convergence of a trust region algorithm than that of its line search counterpart. In the paper, we review recent results on trust region methods for unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization, nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares, nonsmooth optimization and optimization without derivatives. Results on trust region subproblems and regularization methods are also discussed.},

In this paper, a mathematical model and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique are proposed for the simulation and optimisation of the urea plant in an industrial petrochemical company. The developed mathematical model consists of complex vapour--liquid equilibria for the NH                 3                 --CO                 2                 --H                 2                 O--(NH                 2                 )                 2                 CO system in thermodynamic and reaction frameworks. The smart technique (e.g. ANN) considers the CO                 2                 conversion in terms of temperature and the molar ratios of NH                 3                 /CO                 2                 and H                 2                 O/CO                 2                 in the liquid phase. The ANN predictions were compared with the real data and results obtained from the mathematical model. An acceptable agreement was attained between deterministic methods. Through implementation of a systematic sensitivity analysis, it was found that a temperature of 191{$^\circ$}C, a pressure of 132\,atm and a NH                 3                 /CO                 2                 ratio of 2.7 are the optimum process conditions for the urea production.

The effects of the main parameters (biomass characteristics, particle size, gasification temperature, steam/biomass ratio, steam flow rate, reaction catalyst, and residence time) on the exergy efficiency were presented and discussed. The results show that the exergy efficiency of hydrogen production from steam gasification of biomass is mainly determined by the H2 yield and the chemical exergy of biomass. Increases in gasification temperatures improve the exergy efficiency whereas increases in particle sizes generally decrease the exergy efficiency. Generally, both steam/biomass ratio and steam flow rate initially increases and finally decreases the exergy efficiency. A reaction catalyst may have positive, negative or negligible effect on the exergy efficiency, whereas residence time generally has slight effect on the exergy efficiency.},

Recently, machine learning (ML) has been widely employed to predict and optimize the production of biofuels, chemicals, and materials from HTT by feeding experimental data. This review comprehensively analyzed the application of ML for HTT of biomass and systematically illustrated basic ML procedure and descriptors for inputs and outputs of ML models (e.g., biomass compositions, operation conditions, yield and physicochemical properties of derived products) that could be applied in HTT. Moreover, this review summarized ML-aided HTT prediction of yield, compositions, and physicochemical properties of HTT hydrochar or biochar, bio-oil, syngas, and aqueous phase. Ultimately, future prospects were proposed to enhance predictive performance, mechanistic interpretation, process optimization, data sharing, and model application during ML-aided HTT.},

  abstract = {Rate-based process modeling technology has matured and is increasingly gaining acceptance over traditional equilibrium-stage modeling approaches. [Taylor et al. Chem. Eng. Prog. 2003, 99, 28-39] Recently comprehensive pilot plant data for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture with aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) solution have become available from the University of Texas at Austin. The pilot plant data cover key process variables including CO2 concentration in the gas stream, CO2 loading in lean MEA solution, liquid to gas ratio, and packing type. In this study, we model the pilot plant operation with Aspen RateSep, a second generation rate-based multistage separation unit operation model in Aspen Plus. After a brief review on rate-based modeling, thermodynamic and kinetic models for CO2 absorption with the MEA solution, and transport property models, we show excellent match of the rate-based model predictions against the comprehensive pilot plant data and we validate the superiority of the rate-based models over the traditional equilibrium-stage models. We further examine the impacts of key rate-based modeling options, i.e., film discretization options and flow model options. The rate-based model provides excellent predictive capability, and it should be very useful for design and scale-up of CO2 capture processes.}

  abstract = {Urea is widely used in agriculture, industry, and food, while it is also a potential fuel. Large-scale urea production relies on fossil fuels, thus there is a strong need for green urea given the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. A potential alternative is biomass-to-urea; however, it cannot fully convert the biomass carbon into urea. To achieve full carbon conversion, innovative integrated biomass- and power-to-urea processes are designed conceptually. The two green urea production processes are evaluated techno-economically and compared with state-of-the-art methane-to-urea. The results show that the methane-to-urea achieves a system efficiency of 58\% (LHV), while biomass-to-urea only has 39\% (LHV) with unconverted biomass carbon of up to 60\%. The integrated power- and biomass-to-urea has outstanding heat integration performance which fixes all biomass carbon into urea, with an efficiency enhanced up to 53\%. Due to the electricity demand, the levelized cost of the urea of integrated biomass- and power-to-urea is 15 -- 38 and 58 -- 87\% points higher than those of the biomass-to-urea and methane-to-urea for the scale of 10 -- 60 MWth urea production. The available annual hours and electricity price of renewable electricity have a significant impact on the levelized cost of the urea. When the available annual hours decrease from 7200 to 3600 with an electricity price of 73 \$/MWh, the levelized cost of urea increases on average by 13\% from 51 \$/GJ with the plant capacity being 10 -- 60 MWth urea. However, when electricity price is reduced from 73 \$/MWh to 35 \$/MWh with available annual hours of 3600, the levelized cost decreases on average by 15\% from 59 \$/GJ with the same plant capacity.},

  abstract = {To reduce the fossil-fuel consumption and the impacts of conventional ammonia production on climate change, green ammonia production processes using green hydrogen need to be investigated. For commercial production scale, potential alternatives can be based on biomass gasification and water electrolysis via renewable energy, namely biomass- and power-to-ammonia. The former generally uses entrained flow gasifier due to low CO2 and almost no tar, and air separation units are shared by the gasifier and ammonia synthesis. The latter may use solid-oxide electrolyzer due to high electrical efficiency and the possibility of heat integration with the ammonia synthesis process. In this paper, techno-economic feasibility of these two green ammonia production processes are investigated and compared with the state-of-the-art methane-to-ammonia process, considering system-level heat integration and optimal placement of steam cycles for heat recovery. With a reference ammonia production of 50 kton/year, the results show that there are trade-offs between the overall energy efficiency (LHV) and ammonia production cost for all three cases. The biomass-to-ammonia is the most exothermic but is largely limited by the large heat requirement of acid gas removal. The steam cycles with three pressure levels are able to maximize the heat utilization at the system level. The power-to-ammonia achieves the highest system efficiency of over 74\%, much higher than that of biomass-to-ammonia (44\%) and methane-to-ammonia (61\%). The biomass-to-ammonia reaches above 450 \$/ton ammonia production cost with a payback time of over 6 years, higher than those of methane-to-ammonia (400 \$/ton, 5 years). The power-to-ammonia is currently not economically feasible due to high stack costs and electricity prices; however, it can be competitive with a payback time of below 5 years with mass production of solid-oxide industry and increased renewable power penetration.},

  abstract = {Ammonia is a very important chemical industry product. It has a wide range of applications in refrigeration, energy, and fertilizers, and 80\% of ammonia is used as a nitrogen fertilizer. China mainly produces ammonia and urea from coal gasification, which leads to difficult CO2 capture and high energy consumption. This study proposed a new process for the production of ammonia and urea by coal direct chemical looping hydrogen production process (CDCLTU). The coal direct chemical looping hydrogen production replaces the air separation unit and water gas conversion unit of the traditional coal-to-urea process (CTU), which effectively separates and captures CO2 and significantly reduces the energy consumption. A model of the CDCLTU was established using Aspen Plus. Parameter optimization, technoeconomic, and environmental analysis were conducted through simulations. The results showed that CDCLTU could completely replace the air separation system that the CTU relies on. Compared with the traditional process, the utilization rate of C increased from 53.46\% to 67.95\% in the new process. The energy consumption of CO2 separation and capture was reduced by 97.04\%. The CDCLH had a 79.7\% energy efficiency in the hydrogen production process and 99\% capture rate of CO2. The total capital investment was dropped by 41\%, unit urea production cost dropped by 12.1\%, and the payback period dropped from 7.5 to 3.5 years. This paper provides a new direction for clean and efficient utilization of coal resources.},

  abstract = {New generations of biorefinery combine innovative biomass waste resources from different origins, chemical extraction and/or synthesis of biomaterials, biofuels, and bioenergy via green and sustainable processes. From the very beginning, identifying and evaluating all potentially high value-added chemicals that could be removed from available renewable feedstocks requires robust, efficient, selective, reproducible, and benign analytical approaches. With this in mind, green and sustainable separation of natural products from agro-industrial waste is clearly attractive considering both socio-environmental and economic aspects. In this paper, the concepts of green and sustainable separation of natural products will be discussed, highlighting the main studies conducted on this topic over the last 10 years. The principal analytical techniques (such as solvent, microwave, ultrasound, and supercritical treatments), by-products (e.g., citrus, coffee, corn, and sugarcane waste) and target compounds (polyphenols, proteins, essential oils, etc.) will be presented, including the emerging green and sustainable separation approaches towards bioeconomy and circular economy contexts.},
