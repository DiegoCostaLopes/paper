\section{Introduction}
Since 1961, worldwide food supply per capita has raised by 30\%, in large part because of the increase of use of
nitrogen fertilizers to improve agricultural productivity \cite{mbowIPCCSpecialReport2019}. The importance of
fertilizers on agriculture cannot be overstated, with research indicating that half of the world’s population
is sustained by mineral fertilizers. The agricultural sector is also responsible for between 11\% and 15\% of
all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide \cite{ifaEstimatingReportingFertilizerRelated2016}, with fertilizers
accounting for 2\% to 3\% of emissions \cite{brentrupCarbonFootprintAnalysis2016}. Production of mineral fertilizers
is dependent on fossil fuels and raw materials, including mineral extraction,
transportation, manufacturing, and power supply. In this scenario, decarbonizing the fertilizer sector is equally
important to the industry’s expansion \cite{ouikhalfanNetZeroEmissionFertilizers2022}, considering the GHG emissions
reduction preconized in the Paris agreement (2015).
